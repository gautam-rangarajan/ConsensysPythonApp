        "synopsis": "Arthur Curry has married Mera and had a son, Arthur Jr., and splits his life between land, where he lives in the lighthouse of his father Tom and fights crime, and the sea, ruling as the King of Atlantis. However, Arthur finds the diplomatic and bureaucratic royal duties boring, and is always entering conflict with the Atlantean council, who are particularly opposed to Arthur's intent of making Atlantis contact the surface world. Meanwhile, David Kane continues to seek revenge against Aquaman, and follows the research of marine scientist Stephen Shin to look for Atlantean artifacts. Once in an Atlantean ruin underneath the Arctic ice, David finds a black trident, that leads him to be possessed by its creator, who promises that if David helps his Atlantean tribe recover, David will receive the power he desires to destroy Aquaman, his family, and his kingdom.\nFive months later, global warming has worsened, with the surface's climate experiencing extreme weather, and the ocean acidification causing diseases in the sea population. Atlantis is attacked by Black Manta, who takes the kingdom's orichalcum reserves to power his ancient Atlantean machines restored by Shin, injures Mera, and proves himself capable of fighting Arthur in equal terms. Reconvening with his mother Atlanna and Mera's father Nereus, Arthur discovers that David is behind the rising temperatures, as he went after all the hidden reserves of orichalcum, which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases and nearly caused a planetary extinction when used by an ancient Atlantean kingdom. Arthur decides that the way to find out where the Black Manta is hidden is going after one of David's allies, Arthur's half-brother Orm Marius, held captive by the Fisherman kingdom for having killed their king. Arthur breaks out Orm from prison, and after a meeting with crime lord Kingfish discovers David is based on a south Pacific volcanic island.\nArriving in the island, Arthur and Orm discover monstrous fauna and flora that had been mutated by an orichalcum furnace where Black Manta's base is located. Before Atlantis attacks and destroys the island, Orm gets hold of the black trident and has visions revealing its creator was Kordax, the brother of Atlantis founder King Atlan and ruler of the lost kingdom of Necrus, that wound up sealed in an icy prison after losing a war with Atlantis. Given the seal was created by Atlan with blood magic, the blood of any of his descendants could release Kordax, leading David to attack Tom Curry's lighthouse and kidnap Arthur Jr. before heading to Necrus's hiding place, that the Atlanteans discover with Shin's help to be underneath the ice of Antarctica.\nIn Necrus, Arthur attacks David to stop him from injuring Arthur Jr., and David almost defeats Arthur before Orm arrives and disarms him of the black trident. As Orm gets hold of the trident, the spirit of Kordax leaves David for Orm, who proceeds to fight Arthur and use his blood to thaw the ice imprisoning the body of Kordax. With his half-brother freed, Arthur throws the black trident at Kordax, who catches it in mid-air, before throwing his own trident to destroy the black trident and fatally impale Kordax. With Kordax's magic vanishing, Necrus starts to collapse, and as David hangs from a fissure, he refuses Arthur's help and throws himself down the cliff to his death. The Atlanteans and Shin escape to safety, and Arthur and Mera decide to let Orm go and tell the rest of Atlantis that he died, on the condition he remains hidden. Arthur decides that uniting land and sea is necessary to combat climate change, and reveals Atlantis to the human world through an announcement to the United Nations, with the intent of making the underwater kingdom a member state.",
        "plot": "Black Manta seeks revenge on Aquaman for his father's death. Wielding the Black Trident's power, he becomes a formidable foe. To defend Atlantis, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother. They must protect the kingdom."

        "synopsis": "A ship sails towards land and a young Willy Wonka stands on top of a mast, singing a song and when the ship ports in dock, Willy continues singing, but gives away all but 1 of his silver coins, the last of which he drops down a drain. Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called \"Tiddles\" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a \"little orange man with green hair\" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an \"A\" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again. Suddenly, Willy appears and tells Noodle that they are going to go and steal the ledger and break Noodle free from the coup. At the cathedral, Noodle is disguised as a nun and asks the father for some chocolate, but he refuses. Willy and a couple others go to the zoo, steal the giraffe and let it loose in the cathedral. The father phones the \"zoo\", which is Willy and his friends on the other side of the phone and tells them to get rid of it. They do so, just before the Baron's funeral. After hearing what had happened, Slugworth calls the father and rushes to the cathedral. Meanwhile, Willy and Noodle had entered underneath the cathedral and started searching for the book. Finally, Noodle opened a trap door in the wall and got out the book. Unfortunately, Slugworth and his companions got them and throw them in a giant chocolate mixer. Slugworth then tells them that the \"N\" is actually a \"Z\", which belonged to his brother \"Zebbedy\" and told Noodle that he told her mother she would be in good hands, but instead, threw her down the laundry Shute and told her mother that she had died, before locking the door, taking Willys chocolates for the Oompa Loompa, eating them and leaving Willy and Noodle to drown in a river of chocolate. Noodle however, had a plan to let the chocolate lift them and they could bang on the glass. Unfortunately, no one would help them and the two went under.Fortunately, the Oompa Loompa came to the rescue and the duo got out with the book. The now oversized Chief of police got out of the car and is told that he as well as the Chocolatiers are under arrest. The Chocolatiers then start floating again and Willy reveals that the chocolate they had eaten were actually the flying chocolates from earlier on. Slugworth claims they'll be back before floating away.Willy then finally finds out his mother's secret that it's the people you share the chocolate with that matters, not the chocolate itself. Willy shares a piece with everyone, before telling Noodle that her mother lives at the local library and the two get reacquainted and Willy shows the Oompa Loompa an old castle, which he plans to make into a factory and the Oompa Loompa becomes Chief chocolate taster.As the credits roll, the Oompa Loompa reveals what happened to everyone, including Scrubit and Bleacher, who were under arrest, but tried to get out of it by eating the poisoned chocolates and the two have one last kiss.",

        "synopsis": "Many years ago, the Kingdom of Rosas was founded by King Magnifico and his wife Queen Amaya on an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Having studied magic and sorcery, Magnifico gained the ability to grant the wishes of his subjects. When each resident turns 18, a ceremony is held where they give up their wish to Magnifico, who keeps them sealed in his observatory. Once a month, Magnifico selects one of the residents' wishes to be granted before the city.\nIn the present day, 17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the role of Magnifico's apprentice, along with her pet goat Valentino. It is her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, and Asha hopes Magnifico will grant his wish in commemoration. Her best friend Dahlia, who runs the castle bakery alongside their six friends Simon, Gabo, Bazeema, Safi, Dario, and Hal, advises Asha to be honest about her weaknesses. The interview initially goes well, with Magnifico and Asha expressing a shared desire to protect the wishes of Rosas. However, when Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, Magnifico refuses. A heated argument ensues, and it is revealed that Magnifico erases the memories of the citizens' wishes when they are made, and never returns the ungranted wishes to their owners. In doing so, the populace is rendered docile and free of aspirations, and thus dependent on Magnifico.\nAt the wish-granting ceremony that evening, Magnifico makes a point of not granting Sabino's wish, and dismisses Asha as his apprentice. Asha tries to tell her family the truth about Magnifico, but they do not believe her. Frustrated and out of options, Asha wishes to the heavens, and a ball of light drops from the sky, which is revealed to be a physical manifestation of the star she wished on. Unbeknownst to her, Magnifico observes Star's arrival and interprets it as a threat to Rosas. Against his wife's wishes, Magnifico searches his collection of ancient spell books for a way to counter Star's power.\nMeanwhile, Star's magic brings the forest to life, giving voices to the animals and the plants, as well as Valentino. They explain to Asha that all living things come from stardust. Asha, Valentino and Star embark on a mission to recover Sabino's wish, breaking into Magnifico's study with help from Dahlia. Magnifico puts a bounty on information relating to Star, but at a public appearance, the residents of Rosas begin questioning his rule for the first time. Agitated, Magnifico turns to dark magic to keep his power over Rosas.\nAsha returns Sabino's wish, and he is overjoyed to have his memories back. However, Magnifico bursts into the family's home, having been informed by a mole that Asha was responsible for Star's arrival. He crushes her mother Sakina's wish as punishment, causing Sakina to be overcome with grief. Star tries to defend her, but is spotted by Magnifico, who vows to capture him. Asha and her family flee with Star; Sabino and Sakina are sent to a neighboring island for safety while Asha returns to the city in pursuit of the other wishes. Magnifico reveals that Simon is the mole who exposed Asha and grants his wish of being a knight, turning him into his pawn.\nMagnifico creates an all-powerful staff by crushing more wishes. Asha rallies her friends, and they are joined by Queen Amaya as they march on Magnifico's study. Now fully corrupted, Magnifico ascends the castle's tower and saps the power of every wish in Rosas. While the animal companions battle Simon, Asha duels Magnifico, who traps Star in his staff and blacks out the stars.\nAsha, remembering that all humans come from stardust, pleads the citizens of Rosas to make a wish. They do so, and the strength of their desire overpowers Magnifico, sealing him in his staff. Star is released, and the people of Rosas are now free to pursue their wishes of their own volition. Amaya later assumes control of the kingdom, while Magnifico, trapped in a mirror, is locked away in the castle's dungeon. Star then gives Asha a cloak and magic wand; Asha vows to continue Star's work and grant wishes justly.",

        "synopsis": "Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire. This leads to a civil war and the desolation of the Kree home world, Hala, over the next 30 years. The conflict renders the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight.Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the new leader of the Kree, discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands. She harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point, a gateway that allows fast travel across space. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire jump point network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. (Strategic Aerospace Bio-Physics and Exo-Linguistic Response) space station that is run by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Nick analyzes the surge in network energy and traces it back to a planet which is close to where Danvers is located currently. Nick asks Danvers to investigate the surge at its source.Captain Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new jump point that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers' location, Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani)-who has the other Quantum Band on Earth-is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house.\nMonica is an astronaut for S.A.B.E.R. who has the ability to manipulate all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nKamala is a teenage mutant from Jersey City who idolizes Danvers and wears a Quantum Band (thinking of it as a piece of jewelry), a magical bangle that unlocked her ability to harness cosmic energy and create hard light constructs.The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies at 3 locations where they keep switching places every time one of them uses their powers. The 3 locations are The Khan family home, the space station SABER above Earth and the Skrull refugee colony on planet Tarnax.\nThis battle leave the Khan family home destroyed. Kamala's family including mother Muneeba (Zenobia Shroff), father Yusuf (Mohan Kapur) and brother Aamir (Saagar Shaikh) are forced to join the fight to defend themselves.After the three women return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement, and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously.\nThe three join up at a Skrull refugee colony on the planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala.By the time the women figure out the entanglement and how it works, Monica and Kamala end up on Tarnax, while Danvers is on Earth. As Dar-Benn attempts to kill them, Danvers arrives in time and saves them. This is the first time that all 3 women are in the same location at the same time.\nAs Dar-Benn opens the portal to duck the atmosphere, it destabilizes the planet which starts to crumble.After a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names \"the Marvels\". Kamala reveals her Band to Danvers and Rambeau. Danvers explains that the Quantum Bands were used to create the jump point transportation network since ancient times. Rambeau says that since Dar-Benn has just one band, she is using the energy from the Kree Universal Weapon to create unstable jump points and overloading the network.Dar-Benn calls Danvers \"The Annihilator\" and hold her directly responsible for the current state of their home planet Hala. The destruction of the Supreme Intelligence destroyed the planet as well. She promises to restore air, water and sunlight to rejuvenate the planet. Dar-Benn is combining her Quantum Band with the Kree's Universal Weapon to jump start the planet Hala's sun, but it is not enough.Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability to the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, who Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala.The Marvels reach the water planet Aladna before Dar-Benn does and prepare the local population for an attack. Turns out Danvers is married to Prince Yan (Park Seo-Joon) of the planet Aladna.Dar-Benn arrives, and tears open a jump point to draw the planet's water to Hala. As the Marvels attack, Dar-Been sees that Kamala has the 2nd Quantum Band. She almost steals Kamala's Quantum Band, forcing Kamala to flee with Danvers and Rambeau. Danvers wanted to stay and fight to close the unstable jump point sucking in the water, but Kamala activates a normal jump point for them to escape.Dar-Benn's final plan is to use the energy from Earth's sun to restore that of Hala. Dar-Benn's actions destabilize the space around Earth endangering the SABER space station. Danvers Flerken Goose has just given birth to other Flerkens. Now Fury has only pods for 80 people, and 300+ souls on board. So, he orders that the station personnel be swallowed by the newly born and hungry Flerkens, so they can be evacuated to Earth and regurgitated.\nThe Marvels fight and subdue Dar-Benn, but she steals Kamala's Band and uses both bangles to tear open another hole in space.The act destroys Dar-Benn, ends the Marvels' entanglement, and leaves behind a rupture between realities. After Kamala reclaims the Bands, she and Danvers use their combined powers to energize Rambeau, allowing her to close the hole from the other side, stranding her on the other side of the rupture in the process. Kamala returns to Earth and Danvers flies into Hala's sun, using her power to restore it.The short-lived team-up inspires Kamala to seek out other young heroes and form a new group, starting with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld).\nIn a mid-credits scene, Rambeau awakes in a parallel universe where she is greeted by Binary (Lashana Lynch)-an alternate version of her mother Maria-and the mutant scientist Hank McCoy / Beast (Kelsey Grammer).",

        "synopsis": "In 1793, amid the French Revolution, young army officer Napoleon Bonaparte watches Marie Antoinette beheaded by the guillotine. Later that year, Revolutionary leader Paul Barras has Napoleon manage the Siege of Toulon; he successfully storms the city and repels the British ships with artillery. After Maximilien Robespierre is deposed and executed at the end of the Reign of Terror, French leaders, including Napoleon, attempt to restore stability. Again employing artillery, Napoleon suppresses the royalist insurrection on 13 Vend\u00e9miaire in 1795.Napoleon woos aristocratic widow Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais and the two eventually marry. Despite their vigorous sex life, they bear no children. In Egypt, he prevails again at the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798, but rushes home when he hears Jos\u00e9phine has an almost 10-year younger lover, Hippolyte Charles. The Directory criticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and, alongside several collaborators such as Talleyrand, Fouch\u00e9, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos, overthrows them in a coup and becomes First Consul.Napoleon is crowned Emperor of the French by the pope in 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests to Austria an alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and Russians at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian Emperor Francis II for wine-which Russian Tsar Alexander I declines to attend-and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful.Napoleon's mother has him impregnate a mistress, proving that Jos\u00e9phine is infertile. He divorces her in 1810, publicly slapping her in the face when she initially refuses to read her portion of the decree, but the two remain on good terms and continue exchanging friendly letters. Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria, who bears a son one year later.In 1812, Napoleon invades Russia after Alexander reneges on a peace treaty with France. He prevails, despite bloody guerrilla resistance by Don Cossack forces, at the Battle of Borodino, but finds Moscow empty and later set aflame. Napoleon retreats during the winter to France, having lost about half a million men. In 1814, the Coalition force Napoleon's abdication and exile him to Elba.In 1815, upon hearing that Jos\u00e9phine is unwell, Napoleon escapes the island and returns to power in France. She, having been forced into reclusion at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison, dies before he arrives. King Louis XVIII sends the Fifth Regiment to stop Napoleon, but he charms them into joining him.At the Battle of Waterloo in June, Napoleon, having amassed more troops, confronts the British army under the Duke of Wellington. French cavalry charges are repulsed by British infantry squares, and a desperate Napoleon urges his remaining soldiers forward, but this advance is decimated by re-formed lines of enemy infantry. The forces of Prussian Marshal Bl\u00fccher arrive to reinforce Wellington, and the French are broken. As Napoleon retreats, he salutes Wellington.Napoleon is exiled, this time to the island of Saint Helena in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and is seen bantering with children, writing his memoirs that would become a worldwide best-seller, and presenting to his listeners a version of history where he is always right.Napoleon dies in 1821, hearing Jos\u00e9phine beckon him to meet her again. An epilogue notes that roughly 3 million people died in the Coalition Wars (1792-1815).",

He meets and falls in love with Godwin's ward, a childlike young woman named Bella. Godwin reveals that the woman, who was pregnant, died by suicide after leaping off a bridge. He resurrected Bella by replacing at least parts of her brain with that of an infant's, which results in Bella waking and having to relearn a great deal of motor functions as well as social skills. She shows no memory of her past life.With Godwin's permission, Max asks for Bella's hand in marriage. Bella accepts, but as her intelligence rapidly develops, she begins to crave autonomy and runs off with lawyer Duncan Wedderburn. Deciding to let her go, Godwin starts a new experiment with a young woman named Felicity, who matures much more slowly than Bella.Bella and Duncan embark on a grand journey, starting in Lisbon, where the two engage in frequent sex, in addition to other forms of hedonism. She becomes difficult for him to control, so he smuggles her onto a cruise ship for a \"change of scenery\".On the ship, she befriends fellow passengers Martha and Harry, who open her mind to philosophy. Initially attracted to Bella's childlike naivete, Duncan attempts to stunt her growth to no avail. He becomes increasingly exasperated and begins to indulge in drinking and gambling.During a stop at Alexandria, Bella is distraught after witnessing the miserable poverty of the locals and donates Duncan's winnings, which are in turn stolen by the crew. Unable to afford the rest of the trip, the two are kicked off the ship at Marseille, after which they make their way to Paris.Having run out of funds, Bella begins working at a brothel, further enraging Duncan and resulting in his mental breakdown, finally leading her to abandon him. At the brothel, she comes under the tutelage of Madame Swiney and befriends fellow prostitute Toinette, with whom she begins a relationship and who introduces her to socialism.A terminally ill Godwin asks Max to bring Bella to him. Max locates her after tracking down Duncan, who has been institutionalized after his breakdown. Returning to London, Bella reconciles with Godwin and renews her plans to marry Max. The two are interrupted by Duncan and General Alfie Blessington on their wedding day.Alfie, addressing Bella as Victoria, reveals that they were married before her disappearance and that he has come to reclaim her. She abandons Max to learn of her past life but quickly discovers Alfie's violent and sadistic nature, and realizes that she had committed suicide to escape their abusive relationship.Alfie confines Bella to his mansion and threatens her at gunpoint to submit to genital mutilation, demanding she drink a chloroform-laced cocktail to sedate her for the procedure. She tosses the cocktail in his face, causing Alfie to shoot himself in the foot before passing out.Godwin dies peacefully with Bella and Max at his side. Bella decides to carry on Godwin's work with the help of Max and Toinette; Alfie has his brain swapped for that of a goat, while Felicity's intelligence steadily progresses.",

        "synopsis": "In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett (James D'Arcy) at the Cavendish Laboratory in the University of Cambridge. Patrick did not think much of the American Oppenheimer and insulted him every step of the way.\nUpset with Blackett's attitude, Oppenheimer leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Gottingen instead.Oppenheimer completes his PhD there and meets fellow scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz). They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighofer) in Switzerland.\nWanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening (Emily Blunt), a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a troubled communist who later dies in an apparent suicide.\nIn this period of his life, Oppenheimer is shown to have leftist leaning tendencies and he frequently brings his political thoughts into his classrooms. He was also being investigated by the FBI, though this was unknown to him. He wants to unionize the professors on campus and this alienates many people who like him for his work.\nHe makes contributions through the Communist Party to the Spanish Civil far. Oppenheimer considered the Fascists to be a bigger threat compared to the Socialists, which was contrary to the popular thinking at the time. But he never joins the Communist Party formally.In December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be converted into a weapon. Oppenheimer was convinced that the atom could not be split, but when the experiment is replicated in the US and results shown to him, he understands the potential for a chain reaction in fission and that this could be used to make a bomb.\nIn 1939, Hitler invades Poland, and Oppenheimer gradually sheds his views on being neutral and wants to help defeat the Fascists.In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves (Matt Damon)\nrecruits Oppenheimer as director of the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb.\nIn 1942 Oppenheimer, who is Hebrew, is mainly concerned that the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis. Their only hope is that Hitler considers Quantum Physics as a Hebrew science and hence might deny Heisenberg the resources needed to complete his work.\nOppenheimer asks Groves to build the lab at Los Alamos, to bring together the best scientific minds of the country.He assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe (Gustaf Skarsgard) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) at the Los Alamos Laboratory, and also collaborating with scientists Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari), Leo Szilard (M\u00e1t\u00e9 Haumann) and David L. Hill (Rami Malek) at the University of Chicago. Fermi, Szilard and Hill achieve the first self-sustaining nuclear fission reaction, also known as the Chicago-Pile.\nTeller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world. After consulting with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected (since a small fission bomb is required to produce enough force to develop a fusion device), but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay. At the time the US was struggling to produce barely enough Uranium or Plutonium to even make one bomb.\nOppenheimer is approached by scientists who want him to use unofficial channels to collaborate on their research with the Russians, as the US Government is forbidding to do so. Oppenheimer refutes such attempts as treason but doesn't report such approaches to the FBI.Oppenheimer wanted scientists to know everything end-to-end during the Manhattan project, while Groves wanted compartmentalization of information for security reasons. Oppenheimer overrode Groves to have the cross-department meetings and his own security clearance took its own time to arrive.\nGroves was livid with Oppenheimer for not honoring the security protocols around Project Manhattan and for trying to treat it like a science project. He even met Jean Tatlock in 1943 while he was working on the project.Boris Pash (Casey Affleck) is the head of security for the Manhattan project and knew of Oppenheimer's communist leanings. Oppenheimer tells Groves that he lied to Pash with a story about someone from the Russian embassy approaching a person on the Manhattan project team. But Oppenheimer never shared a name with Pash.\nTo protect Oppenheimer, Groves had Pash transferred to London to keep an eye on the German bomb project.Following Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance through the Szil\u00e1rd petition; Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives.\nThe Trinity test is successful (The test takes place at 5:30 am and produces a force of 18.6 KT when the expected yield was 3 KT. The US spent $2 Bn on the project to produce the first Atomic bomb), and President Harry S. Truman (Gary Oldman) orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, inducing Japan's surrender. Oppenheimer wanted Truman to brief Stalin before using it in Japan, but Truman does no such thing. The Soviets are threatened, and Oppenheimer believes that this started the nuclear arms race.\nThough publicly praised, Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities. He later meets Truman, and after expressing his personal guilt, Truman berates Oppenheimer as he considers himself responsible for the decision to use the bomb. Oppenheimer urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman dismisses.Rear Admiral Lewis Strauss is a retired Naval officer and high-ranking member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Strauss had recruited Oppenheimer as a scientific advisor to the AEC, after the war was over.As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest in the middle of the burgeoning Cold War. Oppenheimer says that a Hydrogen presented insurmountable technical difficulties and should not be pursued. He instead tries to convince the AEC to control the spread of nuclear weapons around the world.\nAEC Chairman Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliated him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes (which helped other nations build the Atomic bomb) and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. Oppenheimer suggested that US and Soviets should offer concessions to each other not to pursue a Hydrogen bomb as if US builds one, Soviets will have no choice to build one as well.\nDespite Oppenheimer's objections, Truman green-lights the H-bomb program.\nStrauss believed that Oppenheimer collaborated with the Russians during the Manhattan project, and this is how they were able to produce a bomb in such a short period after the war.Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome.\nStrauss claims that he was the Chairman of the AEC, but the charges against Oppenheimer were brought by William L. Borden (David Dastmalchian), a lawyer and executive director of the JCAE who wrote to the FBI.\nStrauss claims that Borden was a rabid anti-Communist and had access to Oppenheimer's security file on which he based his claims. It is strongly indicated that Strauss provided Oppenheimer's security file to Borden and used Borden to bring Oppenheimer down.Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him.\nOppenheimer brought his brother to work on the Manhattan project, and he was a known Communist. This also goes against Oppenheimer.\nTeller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. Groves supports Oppenheimer.\nThe entire review was done behind closed doors, as an administrative process, with no public hearing and no burden of proof on the prosecution. Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) served as special counsel to the AEC at Oppenheimer's security hearing and was appointed by Strauss. He had full access to Oppenheimer's file while Oppenheimer's attorney didn't have access to his client's file.\nThe board revokes Oppenheimer's Q clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy.In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination.In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson (Hap Lawrence) presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation.\nA flashback reveals Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Oppenheimer instead expressed his belief that they had indeed started a chain reaction-a nuclear arms race-that would one day destroy the world.",

        "synopsis": "Emma Brackett (Kaley Cuoco) is a skilled assassin who is also a loving wife and a caring mother. Emma fell in love with Dave (David Oyelowo) seven years ago, and they eventually got married and had their baby girl, Caroline (Lucia Aliu). Dave's son, Wyatt (Regan Bryan-Gudgeon), from his previous marriage, had also accepted Emma as his mother.\nEmma's frequent work trips made Dave wonder if their marriage had lost its spark.Emma felt incredibly guilty after she forgot her marriage anniversary. She knew she had to make up for it, and after taking a hint from Dave's anniversary present, she decided that they should role-play. They planned to meet at the bar of a fancy hotel as two strangers. Changing appearances was not new for Emma, and she put a brunette wig on.\nDave got stuck in traffic, and in the meantime, an elderly man named Bob approached Emma. He repeatedly questioned her about her job. She could sense things were about to get wild as Bob (Bill Nighy) constantly mentioned that her face looked exceptionally familiar.\nDave and Emma finally got some time alone after Emma managed to bid Bob goodbye. Dave was quite drunk when they returned to their room, and while he caught up on his sleep, Emma had business to take care of. She walked up to Bob's room, and as it turned out, Bob was an independent contract killer. He was in town for business, and he did not expect to come across a familiar face.Emma had a bounty to her name, and Bob recognized her. To be completely sure, he rechecked the picture of Emma (Anna), and it was a perfect match. The bounty was set by an association called the Sovereign, and they wanted Emma alive. Emma used to work for the Sovereign, and they were searching for her after she chose to go off-grid. Bob was ready to cut a deal with Emma as an alternative, and he demanded a 60% commission on her future assignments. He eventually agreed to come down to 40%, but it was still not within Emma's budget, as she was giving 30% commissions to her handler, who was supposed to protect her from the Sovereign.She asked him to go ahead and make the call to Sovereign, though she was pretty confident that the poison in his system would make the task immensely difficult. Emma explained that she had poisoned Bob's drink while they were at the bar. The only reason why Emma met Bob in his room was because she wanted to make sure that he did not make a call to Sovereign.Before dying, Bob tried to shoot Emma, and it resulted in quite a mess. Emma managed to stop Bob, but the condition of the room attracted police attention the next morning. After returning home, Dave was surprised to learn that the man they met at the bar was murdered, and they were the primary suspects. Dave and Emma were seen talking to Bob, and it was captured on CCTV. Emma knew she had to escape before it was too late. She lied about another work meeting and ended up traveling to Berlin to meet her handler, Raj (Rudi Dharmalingam).\nEmma had said that she was going to Boise for a meeting would be back within a day, but never shows up at the airport when Dave goes to pick her up. Dave calls her numerous times, but his phone calls go unanswered.Soon, Dave was brought to the police station for interrogation. He tried to prove his innocence in the most genuine way. But to his surprise, he realized that the detectives were trying to suggest something else. Special Agent Gwen Carver (Connie Nielsen) joined the meeting to discuss Emma's case. Dave was surprised to learn that the woman he was married to was not named Emma Rayburn. She had stolen the identity of a deceased woman by that name, and for the last seven years, she had been living a false life. Dave was shown pictures of his wife arriving at Buenos Aires airport last week. Dave realized that Emma had lied to him about the meeting at Nebraska. Dave learned the true identity of the man he met at the hotel bar, a contract killer named Derek Worley. He was shocked to learn that Raj was not his wife's supervisor but her dealer, who operated on the dark web.Dave discovered that Emma's real name was Anna Peller, and she was a wanted criminal. Dave returned home to find a secret suitcase filled with fake passports, wigs, and ammunition. He knew that he loved the woman he married, and he wanted to have a word with her. The police tried to win Dave on their side, but he never gave in to it.\nHe ended up dialing every number he found in the several visiting cards she had kept hidden, and surprisingly, one connected. Emma, aka Anna, received the call, and he figured out that she was in Berlin. He wanted to discuss the matter in person, and his only option was to travel to Berlin. Meanwhile, Sovereign made it difficult for Anna to escape. They followed her wherever she went, and her handler died in a shootout. Emma was alone.Emma (Anna) and Dave finally reunite at a bar in Berlin. Emma admitted that her real name was Anna, and she was trained to become a killer. Her father was a secret service agent, but he retired early and started his business. Sovereign was the private security company that he started with intelligence agent Gwen Carver. Carver took Anna under her wing when her father died. She was introduced to violence at a young age, and she was trained to kill. During her impressionable years, she believed every word Gwen said and was convinced that she was eradicating evil by killing the bad guys, but as she grew up, she realized it was all a lie.Anna met Dave during a job in Boston, and for the first time, she felt seen. From that day on, all she wanted was a normal life, and she decided to only take jobs once or twice a year to pay for the protection of her family. Even though every detail she had said about herself was a lie, she wanted Dave to believe that her feelings for him were genuine. She escaped to Berlin to get Canadian passports, so her family could start their lives afresh. Emma decided that she would no longer work as a contract killer as soon as she safely escaped the threat of Sovereign. Even after finding out everything about his wife, Dave loved her and wanted to be with her. As Emma and Dave had an honest conversation, members of the Sovereign surrounded them and eventually drugged them and brought them to Gwen Carver.Emma found out that it was not only her and Dave that Gwen kidnapped but also her children. Gwen was desperate to have Emma join Sovereign once again. Gwen believed Anna owed her life to her since she was the one who looked after her. Gwen proposed Anna join Sovereign again, and she promised to never harm her children. Naturally, the children would one day lead the same life that Anna did. Gwen had no use for Dave, and he was only a menace. She instructed Anna to kill Dave, or else she would lose her children.Dave was presented before Anna, and as the two walked into the woods together, a sniper kept a close watch. Anna had a plan in mind, and she shot Dave. He collapsed on the ground, and a Sovereign member came in to check his status. As the woman packed Dave's body, Emma attacked her precisely when the sniper no longer had access to them. After Emma killed the threat, it is revealed that Dave was still alive. She shot him where it would cause the least damage, and he would survive. Emma eventually got the sniper as well, and she was ready to destroy Gwen.A fight erupts between Emma and Gwen's right hand, Ji, and after quite a struggle, Emma triumphed. The student was now better than her mentor, and she attacked Gwen when she least expected it. As Gwen bled to death, Emma walked away from her to find her family. They returned to being a typical family after escaping the Sovereign camp.",

        "synopsis": "During the First Rebellion with the Districts, the patriarch of the noble Snow family, General Crassus Snow, is killed in action. Ten years later, Crassus' eighteen-year-old son and heir, Coriolanus, is determined to restore the family's prosperity. As the tenth annual Hunger Games approaches, he is one of 24 mentors, each assigned an individual tribute. Due to low viewership, Games author Casca Highbottom advises the mentors to ensure they focus on their tribute entertaining the viewers rather than winning the Games.Coriolanus is assigned the District 12 female tribute, Lucy Gray Baird. Lucy Gray sparks the attention of the Capitol after singing during the reaping, as well as slipping a snake into the clothing of the mayor's daughter Mayfair. Coriolanus is determined to ensure Lucy Gray wins over the hearts of the viewers, as the mentor of the best performing tribute will be promised fortune. Coriolanus attempts to befriend Lucy Gray to earn her trust, riding in the same car as the tributes, where he is accidentally dumped into the Capitol Zoo with the tributes, and humanizing her for the cameras, winning the sympathy of the Capitol citizens.Coriolanus presents a proposal to Head Gamemaker Volumnia Gaul involving a sponsorship scheme, allowing Capitol viewers to donate to tribute's mentors, who can send out supplies during the Games. Coriolanus bonds with Lucy Gray, while another mentor, Arachne, is killed by her tribute after she taunts her. During a tour of the arena with others, a rebel bomb explodes, killing several mentors and tributes. Lucy Gray saves Coriolanus from collapsing debris, changing his perception of her; he gifts her some rat poison hidden in his mother's compact to make use of during the Games.During the Games, many tributes quickly die in the initial chaos. Gaul implements Coriolanus' suggestions to the games and Capitol viewership increases. Lucy Gray survives the initial onslaught by escaping through a hole torn from the rebel explosion, hiding in a service tunnel with District 12's male tribute Jessup. Coriolanus' friend Sejanus Plinth, resentful of the cruelty of the Games, sneaks into the arena and mourns alongside his fallen tribute, who was his former classmate in District Two. Coriolanus enters the arena to extract Sejanus, but they are attacked by tributes; Coriolanus is forced to kill one. The footage of the Games is altered to hide their presence.Soon after, Coriolanus realizes Gaul is going to release a tank of genetically modified snakes into the arena to speed up the Games; the snakes do not attack those with scents they are familiar. Coriolanus secretly puts his father's handkerchief that has Lucy Gray's scent into the tank. When the snakes are released into the arena, they kill all remaining tributes except for Lucy Gray; Gaul initially refuses to declare her the victor, until persuaded to do so by Capitol viewers. After the celebration, Coriolanus is confronted by Highbottom, who shows him the handkerchief and poison. As punishment for cheating, Coriolanus is forced to join the Peacekeepers on a twenty year sentence, and insists on transferring to District 12, though unaware of Lucy Gray's fate.In District 12, Coriolanus starts his Peacekeeper training. Sejanus is also forced to join for sneaking into the arena. After a man is hanged, inspiring Lucy Gray with 'The Hanging Tree' song, Coriolanus, Sejanus, and other Peacekeepers go out at night to the Hob in District 12. Coriolanus reunites with Lucy Gray after seeing her sing and they continue their relationship. Meanwhile, Coriolanus observes Sejanus talking with rebels and discovers his plan to help them escape to the north. Coriolanus uses a jabberjay to record Sejanus' proposal, sending it back to Gaul. During another night at the Hob, Coriolanus follows Sejanus, who is talking with Billy Taupe and Spruce, and they get into an altercation resulting in Coriolanus shooting Mayfair and Spruce killing Billy Taupe. They rush to hide the murder weapons, with Coriolanus reassuring Lucy Gray. Sejanus is later hanged for treason along with the other rebels; Lucy Gray tells Coriolanus to join her and escape to the north.On the way north, Coriolanus finds the hidden weapons stashed by Spruce in the cabin by the lake. When she vanishes, Coriolanus realizes Lucy Gray knows about his tip to Gaul about Sejanus, and pursues her with the rifle. He is bitten by a snake set as a trap and becomes disillusioned. Coriolanus returns to the Capitol and is offered a spot at the University courtesy of Sejanus' parents, who are unaware of his role in their son's death. Coriolanus visits Highbottom, who confesses the Games were never intended to be a reality, and were merely a drunken idea that Crassus, who was his classmate and best friend in university, stole the idea from him and made it into reality. Highbottom never forgave Crassus for this, and sees his deceitful nature in Coriolanus. Coriolanus slips rat poison into Highbottom's drug stash. Gaul trains Coriolanus to be a future Gamemaker.",

        "synopsis": "Osage Nation elders bury a ceremonial pipe, mourning their descendants' assimilation into white American society. Wandering through their Oklahoma reservation, which features the annual \"flower moon\" phenomenon of fields of blooms,[19] several Osage find oil gushing from the ground. The tribe becomes wealthy, as it retains mineral rights and members share in oil-lease revenues, though law requires white court-appointed legal guardians to manage the money of full and half-blood members, assuming them \"incompetent\".In 1919, Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to live with his brother Byron and uncle William King Hale on Hale's large reservation ranch. Hale, a reserve deputy sheriff/cattle rancher popularly called \"King\", poses as a friendly benefactor of the Osage, speaking their language and bestowing gifts. He suggests that Ernest court Mollie Kyle, an Osage whose family owns oil headrights. Ernest, who alongside Byron has been committing armed robbery against the Osage, meets Mollie via his day job as a cab driver. A romance develops, and the two marry in a ceremony mixing Catholic and Osage elements. Over time, they raise three children.Hale secretly plans the deaths of several wealthy Osage. He tells Ernest he will inherit more headrights if more of Mollie's family dies. Mollie is diabetic, and her mother Lizzie is ill. After Mollie's sister Minnie dies of a mysterious illness, Hale orders Byron to kill Mollie's other sister, the rebellious Anna. Lizzie and the Osage council blame the reservation's white residents and urge the tribe to fight back.A newsreel of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, in which white people destroyed a black community and killed numerous residents, causes further concern amongst the Osage that they could suffer similarly. Lizzie sees her ancestors welcome her to the afterlife as she dies. Hale has Ernest organize the death of Henry Roan, Mollie's first husband, to collect on his life insurance. However, Ernest botches it, causing Hale to brutally paddle him in a Masonic temple.The local sheriff and judges are corrupt; no investigations are made. An Osage Nation representative seeking to lobby Congress is murdered in Washington, D.C. Mollie hires private detective William J. Burns, but Ernest and Byron beat and chase him away from the reservation.Despite her illness, Mollie travels to Washington with an Osage delegation and asks President Calvin Coolidge for help. Because of this, Hale persuades Ernest to poison Mollie's insulin to \"slow her down\". Mollie's condition worsens, and Ernest sometimes swallows the poison himself from shame. Hale orders Ernest to arrange the murders of Reta, Mollie's last remaining sister, and her husband by having criminal Acie Kirby blow up her house. Mollie inherits all her family's headrights.Due to Mollie's lobbying, the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) sends Agent Thomas Bruce White Sr. and assistants to investigate; they quickly find out the truth. Hale tries to cover his tracks by murdering several of his own men, including Acie, but White arrests Hale and Ernest. The agents find Mollie severely ill and get her proper medical care.White persuades Ernest to confess and turn state's evidence against Hale. W. S. Hamilton, Hale's attorney, tries to convince Ernest to claim he was tortured and recant. However, after one of his and Mollie's daughters dies of whooping cough, Ernest testifies against his uncle. Hale unsuccessfully tries to have Ernest murdered. Mollie meets with Ernest after he testifies, but leaves him when he will not admit to poisoning her.A radio show later reveals the aftermath. Ernest and Hale were convicted and received life sentences. Both were paroled after years of incarceration, despite Osage protests to the parole board. Byron served no prison time due to a hung jury.[c] The Shoun brothers, who gave Ernest the poison for Mollie and were implicated in other \"wasting deaths\", were not prosecuted for lack of evidence. After the trial, Mollie divorced Ernest, remarried, and died of diabetes in 1937 at the age of 50. She was buried with her parents, sisters and daughter. Her obituary did not mention the Osage murders. A 21st century Osage powwow with a large dancing circle is later shown.",

        "synopsis": "In 2011, Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hern\u00e1n Reyes, attempts to stop Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto and Brian O'Conner from stealing the vault containing the fortune of his father. However, Dom uses the vault to ram Dante's turreted SUV into the ocean, but Dante survives and swears revenge against Dom.\nAfter stopping the upload of Project Ares, Dom continues raising his son Brian \"Little B\" Marcos with his wife Letty Ortiz. Later, they are visited by Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Ramsey, Han Lue and Dom's grandmother Abuelita Toretto for a family reunion. After the reunion, the team are assigned for a new mission in Rome, where Dom and Letty decide to stay behind. That night, cyberterrorist Cipher arrives at Dom's house after being betrayed by her team that joined forces with Dante, as the latter blackmailed them with threats to kill their families. Cipher warns him that Dante is after his family and they are in danger. The next day, Little Nobody arrives to take Cipher into custody and confirms to Dom and Letty that Cipher told them the truth, but he also tells them that he never assigned a mission to the team.\nRealizing that they were sent to Dante's trap and unable to communicate with them, Dom and Letty travel to Rome to rescue the team. In Rome, the team is imprisoned in a truck controlled by Dante, containing a time bomb set to explode. Dom and Letty arrive in order to aid the team by managing to stop the truck, but the bomb is released through the streets causing mayhem across the way where Little Nobody is almost killed by a bomb that Dante implanted in his car. Having no time to deactivate the bomb, Dom takes it to the river in order to prevent it from reaching the Vatican. Though Dom manages to do it, the bomb explodes and a great part of the city is destroyed. Dom and his crew are blamed for the destruction and become international fugitives, with Letty being arrested while the rest of the team manages to escape. Aimes, The new leader of Mr. Nobody's organization, believes that Dom's crew is responsible for the attack and starts a manhunt to capture them.\nIn Los Angeles, a special forces team arrives to take Little B, who was under the care of Dom's sister Mia. Soon they are joined by Dom's brother Jakob (having been contacted by Dom) and overpowers the squad. Jakob parts ways with Mia, taking Little B to protect him. Mr Nobody's daughter Tess, who is convinced of Dom's innocence, uses God's Eye in order to find him in a bar. Tess reveals Dante's identity and warns him that Aimes is going after them. Dom travels to Rio de Janeiro to confront Dante, while Tess goes to the prison where Letty is being held to deliberately wound her and sent her to have her wound treated, under Dom's request. At Rio de Janeiro, Dom confronts Dante, where he challenges him to a race. They are joined by other two street racers: Diogo, a friend of Dom's, and Isabel Neves, the sister of Little B's mother Elena Neves, whom Cipher killed.\nDuring the race, Dante tells Dom that he implanted two bombs in the two cars of the other racers and that he must choose who is going to save. Diogo is killed by the explosion, but Dom saves Isabel's life before the bomb explodes, stopping to aid Isabel while Dante wins the race. The following day, Dom arrives at one of Dante's prisons and realizes that his family has been being watched for years. Dom receives a call from Dante vowing to kill his family, while Aimes arrives with his squad and arrests Dom. In London, the rest of Dom's crew discover that their bank accounts were hacked leaving them penniless, except for the dollars that Roman was hiding. While seeking supplies, they soon learn that whoever turns them in to the authorities, would receive a cash reward in the millions.\nWithout any choice, the team are forced to meet Deckard Shaw and ask him for help. Shaw is initially reluctant to accept, but soon agrees to help them after learning that his mother is a fugitive for helping Dom. While Dom is being taken into custody, Aimes and his team are soon attacked by Dante's mercenaries. Aimes join forces with Dom to fight them, while Dom soon starts to fight Dante. However this was revealed to be a trap as Dante has kidnapped Isabel. Tess arrives to help Dom but is wounded by a sniper hired by Dante and steals God's Eye, which he uses to go after Brian in Portugal. Dom manages to save Isabel as Dante escapes in a helicopter. Isbael takes Tess to the hospital while Aimes, recognizing Dom's innocence, agrees to help him. The rest of Dom's crew also realizes that Dante has God's Eye and travels to Portugal to stop him.\nArriving at Portugal, Jakob and Little B are chased by a group of mercenaries, where the two initially manage to overpower them. However, Dante manages to kidnap Little B. Dom arrives at Portugal to rescue Brian where he is confronted by the remaining mercenaries. Realizing that his brother is about to be killed and having his supply tank compromised, Jakob sacrifices himself to kill the remaining mercenaries and give enough time for Dom to rescue Little B. After destroying two helicopters, Dom is able to rescue Little B only to be confronted by two trailers that they were going to crash in an attempt to kill Dom. The plane with Dom's remaining crew also arrives, but is later destroyed by Aimes, who is revealed to have been working for Dante all the time, apparently killing them.\nWith no choice, Dom and Little B barely escape by jumping off the dam. Dante reveals that he implanted bombs on the dam with the intention of destroying them, anticipating that Dom would escape, having studied every step that Dom would take.

The Barbies preside over Barbieland in a matriarchal system and work high-position jobs while the Kens spend time as futile subordinates living in the Barbies' shadow. Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling) has feelings for Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) and constantly vies for her attention, but she doesn't recognize.During a dance party at her house, (Stereotypical) Barbie suddenly starts questioning her mortality. The next day, Barbie suffers an existential crisis, experiencing a series of mishaps including her perfect skin with blemishes and her arched feet going flat. The other Barbies suggest she visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), who informs her the human girl who is playing with her is unhappy. To fix her crisis, Barbie must travel to the real world, find the girl and help her.On her way to the real world, Barbie finds (Beach) Ken stowed away in her car. He convinces her to let him join and the two travel to Los Angeles, where they accidentally get arrested several times. Barbie learns to cry upon taking in how flawed the real world is, before complimenting an old woman on her beauty. Ken wonders off and discovers the patriarchy, feeling accepted for the first time. He excitedly travels back to Barbieland.At a local school, Barbie finds her human girl, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), and tries to help her.

Using Gloria's speech, they free the Barbies of their subjugation before turning the Kens against each other to distract them from changing the constitution. As the Kens fight on the beach, the Barbies restore Barbieland's matriarchy back into the constitution.A distraught Ken expresses disappointment in being nothing other than an accessory to Barbie, to which she encourages him to be his own person. The two apologize to each other for their mistakes. President Barbie (Issa Rae) makes a friendly deal with the Mattel CEO before agreeing to equality for the Kens and other discontinued toys.

When their clashing egos prevent them from performing the \"Perfect Family Harmony\", a powerful ability that Trolls can achieve when they are in complete sync, the brothers argue and break up the band. Branch is left alone to be raised by his grandmother Rosiepuff.In present day, about a month after preventing the Rockpocalypse, Branch and Poppy attend Bridget and Gristle's wedding in Bergen Town. They are interrupted by John Dory, who reveals that Branch's closest brother Floyd has been captured by Velvet and Veneer, two Mount Rageon teenagers who wish to be pop stars. The siblings have imprisoned Floyd in a diamond perfume bottle, which they use to extract his essence and improve their singing, although the process could eventually kill him. As the Perfect Family Harmony is the only thing that can destroy diamond, Branch reluctantly agrees to help John Dory find their brothers and rescue Floyd. Along with Poppy and Tiny Diamond, they set out in John Dory's armadillo-like portable van named Rhonda.They find Spruce at the Vacay Island resort, where he has changed his name to Bruce and started a family. Bruce is reluctant to help, until his wife and 13 kids convince him to do so. The group later finds Clay at an abandoned Bergen miniature golf course, inhabited by a hidden colony of Pop Trolls who do not know that the Bergens are no longer their enemies, having been separated from the other Pop Trolls when they fled the final Trollstice. [a] The hidden troll colony's leader, Viva, reveals herself to be Poppy's long-lost sister. At first, Poppy is delighted, but the visit turns sour when Viva refuses to believe the Bergens have changed, and tries to stop Poppy's group from leaving the golf course. They manage to escape thanks to Clay, and Poppy and Viva separate with broken hearts.Meanwhile, Velvet and Veneer continue to strip Floyd of his essence. Velvet reveals that she forged Floyd's handwriting and sent a note to John Dory, in order to bait Floyd's brothers to come and rescue him. Furthermore, Velvet and Veneer's assistant Crimp invents shoulder-pad suits that enhance the extraction, which the siblings plan to use when they capture all of BroZone.The Trolls make it to Mount Rageous, but once again argue and fail to reach Perfect Family Harmony. When his brothers decide they will split up again after saving Floyd, Branch scolds them for abandoning their family and still treating him like a baby, reminding them that he lived his whole life alone after their grandmother got eaten. Branch, Poppy and Tiny locate Floyd on their own, but Velvet and Veneer capture John Dory, Clay, and Bruce, making a rescue even more difficult. Branch and Poppy confront Velvet and Veneer when they start mingling with a crowd of fans, prompting them to drive away in their limo. During the ensuing chase, Velvet and Veneer begin using the shoulder-pads to extract the essence from Branch's brothers in order to put on a show. Branch and Poppy are soon helped by Viva, who joined forces with Bridget and Gristle after they stumbled onto the golf course during their honeymoon.Seeing that Floyd is just about out of essence, Branch tells his brothers that they all simply need to put aside their egos and work as a team. They, along with Poppy and Viva, perform the Perfect Family Harmony and break free of their prisons just as Floyd loses the last of his essence, but he is quickly revived. Veneer, who had been second-guessing Velvet's machinations, publicly confesses everything, and they are sent to prison.The Trolls return to Vacay Island and witness BroZone's comeback concert, joined by Kismet, another band Branch was once part of. Later, Poppy and Viva join BroZone, under Branch's proposal, as honorary members.",

        "synopsis": "In New York City, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) prepares to exact vengeance against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne). He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder (George Georgiou), the \"one who sits above the Table\". Elder says that killing him would not change John's fate and that John would ever experience peace in death.\nIn response, High Table member Marquis Vincent Bisset De Gramont (Bill SkarsgArd) summons New York Continental hotel manager Winston (Ian McShane) and his concierge Charon (Lance Reddick), where he explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to kill John and chastises Winston for previously failing to do so.\nAs punishment, the Marquis strips Winston of his managerial duties, declares him \"Ex-Communicado\", destroys the New York Continental (after giving one hour to evacuate all guests) and executes Charon. Winston knows that Charon has been killed unfairly in his place, so he can endure that pain for as long as he lives.\nThe Marquis then enlists Caine (Donnie Yen) - a blind, retired High Table assassin - to kill his old friend John, threatening to murder Caine's daughter if he refuses to do so.John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada). Koji's daughter Akira advises Koji not to shelter John as she knows that the High table will inevitably come. But Koji will not abandon his friend in his hour of need. Koji informs John that killing the Elder was a mistake as they have destroyed the New York Continental, and Osaka might be next.\nKoji wants John to think about where this ends as the table will never stop.The Marquis' second-in-command Chidi (Marko Zaror), backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel.\nKoji's daughter Akira (Rina Sawayama), the hotel's concierge, evacuates the hotel just before the High Table \"Deconsecrates\" it, igniting a melee. Akira says that John has no right to be at the Osaka, and that many people, including her, could die because he broke the rules.John fights through waves of armored assassins, leading to a showdown against Caine. A bounty hunter named Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson) interrupts their fight and allows John to escape after determining the current bounty (declared by the High Table at $20 million) for killing John to be insufficient. Mr. Nobody intends to kill John when the bounty is large enough, and till then he decides to protect John.\nAkira is shot by the table's mercenaries, but she is only wounded. A wounded Koji repeatedly attacks Caine on John's behalf (as Caine wanted to know John's location in the hotel), until Caine reluctantly kills Koji, but spares Akira.\nAkira finds John and vows revenge against Caine. She wants John to kill Caine as retribution for Koji.The Harbinger is the High Table's emissary and tells the Marquis that the bloodshed at the Osaka Continental was unnecessary. But the Marquis is adamant about destroying the idea of John. Marquis summons Mr. Nobody who demands $50 million to kill John. Marquis stabs Mr. Nobody's hand and forces him to agree to find John for $23 million.John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's grave-site. John wants to kill the Marquis, but Winston says that the High Table will simply replace him. Winston suggests that John invoke an old High Table tradition to challenge the Marquis to a duel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. John was once part of a crime family who sat at the High Table, but he was kicked out. Winston tells John to get readmitted to his family. They would challenge the High Table and offer John as a proxy.John travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, with whom he had severed ties, to request readmission. His adoptive sister Katia (Natalia Tena) stipulates that for readmission, John must kill Killa Harkan (Scott Adkins), a High Table member who murdered her father.\nMr. Nobody tells Marquis that John is in Berlin, but now Marquis wants him to kill John for the $23 million. Mr. Nobody knows that Marquis is stringing him along.Katia delivers John to Killa. Caine and Mr. Nobody were already there as they were tracking John on the orders of the Marquis. Caine and Mr. Nobody both want to kill John, so Kill engages them in a poker game, with the winner deciding what happens next. Killa cheats at the game to produce a 5 of a kind hand and makes it clear that he would kill Caine and Mr. Nobody as well.\nWith the aid of Caine and Mr. Nobody, John manages to kill him and regain his status.\nCaine stops Mr. Nobody from killing John, as he wants to kill John.Winston relays John's challenge to the Marquis, acting as John's 'second' and requests that, should John win, his Excommunicado to be revoked and the New York Continental be rebuilt, fully funded by the High Table; should John lose, however, Winston would also die as the challenger's 'second'.In Paris, John and the Marquis decide on the duel's parameters - dueling pistols at sunrise the following day at Sacr\u00e9-Coeur - in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger (Clancy Brown), the Table's emissary. The Marquis nominates a reluctant Caine to take his place, while the Harbinger warns that both John and Winston will be executed should either fail to appear on time.\nMarquis tells Caine that if he kills John, he and his daughter will be free of all obligations to the High Table.Marquis is convinced that John Wick is a man without a purpose. He has nothing to live for, to kill for, or to die for. He is a ghost looking for a grave and Marquis will help him to get there.The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol (9mm Pit Viper) and a new ballistic suit. The Marquis intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him. Sunrise is at 6:03 AM.\nJohn fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, including Mr. Nobody, who negotiates a bounty increase to $40 million. Mr. Nobody engages John in hand-to-hand combat, during which John gains the upper hand forcing Mr. Nobody to summon his ferocious dog for help.\nDuring their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody's dog, causing Mr. Nobody to abandon his pursuit of John.John is stopped by Marquis's agents from reaching the summit and has only 3 minutes left to make his deadline. This is when Caine arrives and says that he wants him at the duel at the appointed time.\nAfter Caine and Mr. Nobody assist John in fighting off several assassins - including Chidi, whom Mr. Nobody kills - on the Rue Foyatier, they reach the summit just in time for the duel. Just before entering the duel, Caine stabs John in his right wrist, preventing him using his right hand during the duel.John and Caine wound each other through two rounds of dueling (first round of shot at 30 paces, second round of shot at 20 paces), and the third round (which is at 10 paces from the center) comes to a halt when Caine severely wounds John. Marquis frees Caine and his daughter from all obligations to the High Table.\nDemanding the right to administer the Coup De Grace, the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis for his arrogance, revealing that John has not yet fired his third bullet. John then promptly executes the Marquis with a head-shot, ending the duel.The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table and Winston's reinstatement of Hotel Manager of the New York Continental, which will be rebuilt with the High Table's funds. John reflects upon his life and marriage before succumbing to his injuries. Sometime later, back in New York, Winston and the Bowery King bid farewell to John at his grave, located next to that of his wife Helen.In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter but is approached by a vengeful, knife-wielding Akira.",

        "synopsis": "The Motherworld has been ruled by 1000 Kings in succession. The royal blood lines consumed everything on the home planet and sent their armies outward to conquer new worlds for their resources. Only an assassin stuck down the King and Queen, severing the bloodline forever.\nA senator named Balisarius seized the power and started to crush the rebellion in the outer reaches of the empire. Balisarius sent his most brutal commander Noble, to deal with the rebellion.Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), the sadistic admiral of the militaristic Imperium, arrives on the backwater moon of Veldt on behalf of the Motherworld, an interstellar empire fueled by centuries of conquest and war.\nVeldt is simple farming community. Kora works the fields and is pursued by Den (Stuart Martin), a local farmer. Kora has only spent 2 seasons at Veldt and says that she is a product of war, and that the idea of family was beaten out of her as she was turned into a soldier.The villagers saw the dreadnought enter their atmosphere. Kora alerts the villagers. Gunnar is a farmer who advocates dealing with the Imperium as partners, but Kora says that Imperium can only subjugate and never partner. Gunnar sold the excess produce to rebels in the previous season, and Kora wants Imperium to be given what they ask for, before they dig too deep. Sindri, the head of the village refuses to negotiate with the Imperium.Noble explains that his troops are hunting for a band of rebels led by siblings Devra (Cleopatra Coleman) and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and offers to buy the village's surplus grain at 3 times the market value. Noble says that the Bloodaxe have been attacking the Imperial ports and stores and as such the army is running low on provisions.\nThe village's leader, Sindri (Corey Stoll), refuses the offer, claiming they barely have enough to survive as their land is rocky and their winters are harsh. A farmer, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), contradicts Sindri's claim, indicating that the village might have some surplus.\nNoble kills Sindri and orders Gunnar to prepare enough grain, which will not leave the village with enough to survive, in ten weeks. The village produces 12,000 bushels of harvest and Noble wants 10,000 bushels for the army.Noble departs, leaving a handful of soldiers, including Marcus (Greg Kriek) (a cruel soldier) & Private Aris (Sky Yang), who is disillusioned with the Imperium and Motherworld's immorality-and a \"Jimmy\" robot (JC-1435) (Anthony Hopkins) to oversee the harvest. The Jimmy robots refused to fight once the King was slain, which was driven by something in their programming.\nAfter being harassed by Marcus, Jimmy starts to become independent. The villager Sam shows empathy with Jimmy and befriends him.\nJimmy tells Sam the story of their slain King and their daughter Issa. Issa was supposed to usher in an era of peace and prosperity across the Empire. Jimmy says that Sam reminds him of Issa. He says that Jimmy's were created to protect Issa.Kora wanted to flee the village when Gunnar and Den decide to give the Imperium what they want and depend on their mercy for survival.\nKora (Sofia Boutella), finds the other soldiers holding another villager Sam (Charlotte Maggi) and Aris hostage, preparing to sexually assault Sam, and kills them with help from Jimmy, who has defected from the soldiers. This is unprecedented as Jimmys have not killed anyone since Issa was killed.\nKora warns the villagers that Noble will massacre the village once he returns, unless they mount a defense.Kora and Gunnar depart for the port town of Providence to recruit warriors for the village's defense, including Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced Imperium general who turned his own forces on the Motherland. Gunnar accompanies Kora to find the Bloodaxe whom he supplied grain in the last season.\nDuring their journey, she reveals to Gunnar that she once served the Imperium as a soldier, having been adopted and renamed to Arthelais by Balisarius (Fra Fee), an Imperium commander, after he killed her family and eradicated her home planet's population when she was 9 years old. At the age of 18, she became an officer and was given a command position. She was now fighting on distant worlds under the banner of an empire that killed her entire family.\nShe became bodyguard to Motherworld princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald), who was expected to usher in an end to the Imperium's conquests. Issa was rumored to have the power to give life.\nShe was unable to protect Issa during her coronation, when the royal family (King (Cary Elwes) and Queen (Rhian Rees)) was assassinated, and Balisarius subsequently declared himself regent before renewing its conquests.Arriving at Providence, the pair learns from Gunnar's contact that Titus is most likely on Pollux.\nThe pair meets smuggler and criminal Kai (Charlie Hunnam), who agrees to take them to recruit Titus. On the way to the planet Pollux, Kai takes them to two additional warriors: Tarak (Staz Nair), a beast tamer, and Nemesis (Doona Bae), a talented swords-woman enhanced by cybernetics.\nThe group arrives at a gladiator on a remote moon, finding Titus in a drunken stupor. Titus used to command the Eastern forces for the Old King.\nTitus initially refuses but agrees to join them after Kora suggests that he avenge his fallen soldiers, who died after Titus surrendered to Balisarius.Using Gunnar's previous dealings with the Bloodaxes, they then arrive at planet Sharaan (The home planet of King Levitica) to meet them and their rebellion, intending to recruit them. Darrian agrees to defend the village and brings with him a handful of rebels, including Millius (E. Duffy), with him, while Devra considers a fight against Noble's dreadnought, the King's Gaze, hopeless and a waste of their resources. She says that a dreadnought is a destroyer of worlds and cannot be fought with a few fighters.\nAfter they depart Sharaan, Noble arrives and eradicates its population as punishment for assisting the rebels.Kai tells Kora that he has been moved by her quest to abandon his illicit life as a smuggler and that he has one last shipment to drop off to leave that life behind him and join her in her fight to save the village. He takes the group to a trading post at which Noble's ship has arrived and restrains them, save for Gunnar, betraying them to Noble and revealing he had always intended to do so for the bounties on their heads.Noble identifies Kora, Tarak, Nemesis, and Titus for their history-Kora and Titus as deserters, Tarak as a criminal and former prince, and Nemesis as the killer of several Imperial officers in revenge for her murdered children.\nNoble says that once he presents their bodies to the Regent, he will be proclaimed as a Hero of the Realm and granted a seat on the Senate.Kai demands that Gunnar paralyze Kora; Gunnar instead frees her and kills Kai. The other warriors are unshackled as well. A battle ensues, with Darrian and Noble-the latter at the hands of Kora-among its casualties. Darrian sacrifices his life to save his fellow fighters and to bring down Noble's ship, without which none of them would have survived.\nAfterwards, the surviving warriors return to Veldt together, with Jimmy watching them from afar on their way to the village.Noble's corpse is recovered by Motherworld forces, and he is resurrected after having spoken on an astral plane with Balisarius, who demands that Noble end the insurgency against him and bring Kora to him alive so he can execute her himself.",

        "synopsis": "The planet-eating Unicron (Colman Domingo) attacks the home-world of the Maximals, an advanced race of Transformers. The Terrorcons, Unicron's heralds led by Scourge (Peter Dinklage) (the leader of the Terrorcons and a trophy hunter who transforms into a black Peterbilt 359 logging semi truck), want the Transwarp Key which can open portals through space and time and can help Unicron consume planets faster.\nThe Maximal leader Apelinq (David Sobolov) (the previous Maximal leader who transforms into a mountain gorilla and sports retractable blades on his arms) sacrifices himself to allow the other Maximals to escape the planet before Unicron devours it. Now under the command of Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman) (the leader of the Maximals who transforms into a western lowland gorilla), the Maximals flee to Earth with the key.\nUnicron assigns Scourge to find the Key and use it bring him to that planet.In 1994 Brooklyn, Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), an ex-military electronics expert, struggles to find a job to support his ill brother Kris (Dean Scott Vazquez). Noah has job interviews with private security agencies, but his old commanding officers from the US Army tell his prospective employers that Noah is unreliable. The family is 3 months behind payments on the hospital bills and the hospital refuses treatment to Kris till the pending accounts are paid.\nNoah is convinced by his friend Reek (Tobe Nwigwe) to steal a Porsche to sell only to discover that it is the Autobot Mirage (Pete Davidson) (an Autobot spy who can project holograms and transforms into a silver-blue Porsche 964 Carrera RS 3.8, and briefly, into a Formula One car, a Lamborghini Countach, a garbage truck, and an exoskeleton-suit) in disguise.Concurrently, museum intern Elena Wallace (Dominique Fishback) studies an ancient statue of a falcon bearing the Maximal symbol and accidentally breaks it open to reveal the key hidden inside. The key releases an energy pulse detected by Autobot leader Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) (the leader of the Autobot resistance who transforms into a red 1987 Freightliner FLA semi truck), who summons the other Autobots, including Arcee (Liza Koshy) (an Autobot sharpshooter who transforms into a red-white Ducati 916 motorcycle) and Bumblebee ( an Autobot scout who transforms into a modified yellow-black 1970s Chevrolet Camaro).\nMirage is contacted in the middle of Noah's attempted theft, and he is roped into the Autobots' mission to recover the key so they can use it to return to their home world, Cybertron. Noah is convinced by Mirage to help them break into the museum and find the Key.Drawn by the key's signature, the Terrorcons arrive on Earth and attack the Autobots outside the museum, with Elena becoming caught up in the conflict. Scourge kills Bumblebee, steals the key, and retreats when the Maximal Airazor (Michelle Yeoh) (A Maximal warrior who transforms into a peregrine falcon) arrives.\nAirazor reveals that the Maximals have been hiding on Earth for millennium, and Scourge only has half of the Transwarp Key, which was split in two to keep it away from Unicron.\nOptimus insists that the key be reassembled so the Autobots can use it to return home, while Noah secretly plots with Elena to destroy the key to keep Earth safe.Elena deduces that the other half of the key is in a hidden temple in Peru. The cargo plane Autobot, Stratosphere (John DiMaggio) (an Autobot Air-Soldier who transforms into a Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar cargo plane) takes them to Peru, where they meet with Wheeljack (Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez) (an Autobot scientist and mechanic who transforms into a brown and white 1970s Volkswagen Type 2 panel bus), who leads them to the temple.\nHowever, the other half of the key is revealed to no longer be there. The Terrorcons attack again, and Scourge corrupts Airazor with Unicron's dark energy. Subsequently, the Autobots meet Optimus Primal and the other Maximals, who entrusted the second half of the key to a human tribe they have worked with for millennium.\nOptimus Primal reveals that the Maximals use the Trans Warp Key to visit young new worlds for the expansion of life throughout the Universe. Primal also tells Prime how they allied with humans who shared their world with them. And the humans helped hide the key and also look over the Maximals for hundreds of years.\nPrimal also puts Bee to rest in the valley which is rich in raw Energon. It will take a great power to ignite the Energon which will in turn review Bee.Scourge's corruption overtakes Airazor, whom Primal reluctantly kills at her request to save Elena. In the chaos, Noah attempts to destroy the second half of the key, but Optimus convinces him otherwise. Scourge steals it and then reassembles the two halves, erecting a tower and opening a portal above the Earth, which Unicron will soon go through.Optimus and Noah agree to work together to protect their home worlds from Unicron. While Autobots and Maximals battle the Terrorcon army, Noah and Elena sneak in close to the Key, planning to deactivate it with an access code Elena has uncovered.\nDuring the battle, Scourge wounds Mirage, who was protecting Noah, but transforms his damaged body into a powered exoskeleton-suit for Noah so they can fight together. Bumblebee is reactivated when the key activates the Energon-infused valley. He helps the Autobots and Maximals turn the tide of the battle.Optimus kills Scourge, but not before the latter damages the control console to prevent the portal from being shut down. Optimus destroys the key and collapses the portal, willing to sacrifice himself, but Noah and Primal save him from being sucked into the imploding vortex, which destroys the remaining Terrorcon army and leaves Unicron stranded.In the aftermath, the Autobots, unable to return to Cybertron, proclaim Earth as their new home and vow to continue protecting it alongside the Maximals. Elena receives recognition for discovering the temple in Peru while Noah attends an interview for a security job but finds he is actually being invited to join the secret military organization G.I. Joe, who will cover Kris's health-care.In a mid-credits scene, Noah repairs Mirage using junk Porsche parts from Reek who claims it is not road-worthy, and Noah disproves him by calling to Mirage to transform in front of Reek.",

        "synopsis": "The Expendables are sent to Libya to prevent mercenary Suarto Rahmat (Iko Uwais) from stealing detonators for nuclear warheads on behalf of a mysterious terrorist named Ocelot (Andy Garc\u00eda). Rahmat and his forces had attacked an old chemical factory which was operational under Gaddafi's regime, but now is being used as a makeshift storage facility for his nuclear accessories, guarded by factions of the Libyan army.\nRahmat's private army is very well equipped and even has air cover from predatory drones. The Libyan forces are no match for Rahmat.CIA operative Marsh sends in the Expendables to retrieve the nuclear detonators. Marsh says that Ocelot is planning an international incident by pairing the detonators with nuclear warheads. Many years ago, the CIA hired Barney to expose Ocelot's identity. But Ocelot ambushed Barney and almost killed his entire team. Rumors persisted that Barney created the myth of Ocelot to bury his own mistakes.The Expendables team is led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and formed by members Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), with new members Easy Day (Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson) and Galan (Jacob Scipio).\nAs soon as the Expendable's plane enters Libyan airspace, they are shot at with SAMs. Barney manages to land his plane, deploy the ground teams and takes off into the air again. Their age shows as Jensen takes 2 shots at Rahmat with his sniper rifle and misses due to his poor eyesight. However, they are incapacitated when all of their vehicles are destroyed in the ensuing fight.\nWhen Barney's plane runs out of flares, Christmas tries to save Barney by abandoning pursuit of Rahmat and taking out the SAM sites targeting Barney's plane.\nWhen Rahmat shoots their plane down with a large caliber gun, the team finds what appears to be Barney's burned corpse in the wreckage, identified solely by his ring.\nRahmat escapes with the detonators in a helicopter.At Barney's memorial service, CIA operative Marsh (Andy Garc\u00eda) reveals that the team will pursue Ocelot and Rahmat, but without Christmas, who jeopardized the mission trying to save Barney.\nChristmas is replaced by Gina (Megan Fox), his former lover, who also brings an operative named Lash (Levy Tran) into the team. The team travels to Asia to stop Rahmat from taking delivery of the other nuclear materials to assemble a warhead, but is secretly tracked by Christmas, who had slipped Gina a tracking device earlier. Barney's apparent death opened a sealed file which states that there is an eyewitness that could identify Ocelot. Marsh now knows the identity of the witness.Marsh says Ocelot plans to provoke World War III by letting the nuclear warheads explode in the Russian Far East, transporting them on a ship disguised as an American aircraft carrier. As the Expendables and Marsh board the ship, they are ambushed and taken hostage. Marsh is taken away to negotiate a prisoner-exchange for the eyewitness. Rahmat offers to release Marsh in exchange for the witness who can identify Ocelot.Meanwhile, Christmas travels to Thailand to recruit former Expendable Decha (Tony Jaa), who has turned towards pacifism but agrees to bring him to the ship to avenge Barney. As Christmas fights his way through the ship, Decha has a change of heart and helps him rescue the rest of the team. The team finds a nuclear bomb on board and the only way to disarm it is with a kill switch which works on a short range only. The team speculates that Rahmat would have the kill switch on his person.They launch an attack on Rahmat's forces, during which Christmas fights and kills him. Before dying Rahmat says that he does not have the kill switch and only Ocelot has it. However, Toll has been heavily wounded and needs immediate medical care.During the prisoner exchange, Marsh is revealed to be Ocelot when he kills the witness, hoping to financially profit from igniting World War III. The ship was headed for Russian waters where detonating the warhead would be perceived as an act of war against the Russian people by the Americans.Christmas starts by blowing up the helicopter on which the witness was brought in on the ship, and which was Marsh's escape vehicle.\nMarsh responds by throwing the detonator in the ocean which makes sure that the bomb is going off. While the team leaves on Decha's boat (which was being towed behind the ship) to save Toll, Christmas stays behind to turn the ship around to avoid a global conflict by steering the ship out of Russian waters.Marsh directs all of his remaining forces to the bridge to try and turn the ship back around. But all the soldiers are neutralized by a mysterious helicopter gunship.\nChristmas confronts Marsh, who is killed by Barney, who surprises everyone by revealing that he faked his death, hoping to lure Ocelot out of hiding. Barney rescues Christmas off the ship and then blows the ship apart forcing it to sink under the water.\nThey escape the nuclear explosion on the helicopter and celebrate with the team.",

        "synopsis": "Mike Schmidt, a mall cop, loses his job after assaulting a negligent father who he confused for being a kidnapper. He is sent to visit career counselor Steve Raglan, who offers him work as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Though initially reluctant, Mike accepts the offer after social services threaten to take custody of his younger sister Abby, and pass her over to his estranged aunt Jane, due to concerns of Mike's emotional stress.On the first night, Mike falls asleep and has a dream where he witnesses the kidnapping and presumed murder of his brother Garrett, whom was taken away by an unknown man. Mike is then met by five unknown children whom allegedly witnessed the kidnapping, and promptly run away. On the second night, Mike meets police officer Vanessa Shelly, who shows him around the restaurant and tells him that the place closed in the 1980s after five children were murdered there; the bodies were never found. Mike's dream is repeated, though after Mike attempts to confront one of the children, he is attacked and wakes up to find himself wounded physically, though his wounds are treated by Vanessa.On the third night, Jane hires a group of delinquents to vandalize the restaurant in order to get Mike fired, an act which would enable her to gain custody of Abby. As the break-in occurs, the restaurant's animatronic mascots - Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Foxy and Bonnie - come alive and murder the delinquents. One of the vandals happens to be Abby's babysitter Max, which requires Mike to bring Abby to his next shift. The animatronics become active once more, being hostile towards Mike though being friendly towards Abby. The animatronics befriend her, though Vanessa and Mike are hesitant, with the latter discovering that the animatronics are possessed by the ghosts of dead children, whom are led by a boy with blonde hair and allegedly talk about a \"yellow rabbit\" consistently.In between shifts, Mike explains the disappearance of Garrett when he was young, which became a cold case and that he had been taking sleeping pills every night in order to repeat his dreams and find who kidnapped his brother. After panicking from Abby's increasing relationship with the animatronics on the fourth night, Vanessa warns Mike to not bring her to the restaurant again. Mike gets Jane to babysit Abby, much to her frustration, as he goes back to the restaurant during the day and overdoses on his sleeping pills.Inside the dream, the five children appear again and tell Mike that he can stay with Garrett forever, in exchange for Abby. At Mike's house, Jane is murdered by \"Golden Freddy\", a variant of Freddy Fazbear possessed by the blonde boy, who takes Abby back to the restaurant. Mike is attacked several times inside of his dream and wakes up strapped to a torture device that attempts to tear off his face. He escapes the machine and flees the restaurant, but is critically injured until Vanessa arrives to help him.After Mike details his dream, Vanessa reveals that she is the daughter of the serial killer that murdered his brother and the other five children, William Afton, and that the animatronics and souls of the children are under his control. She also tells him that they will likely attempt to murder Abby, much to Mike's dismay. He drives to the restaurant with the necessary equipment to disable the animatronics and save Abby, who is taken into a backroom by Chica. Chica tries to kill Abby by stuffing her inside of an animatronic suit with springlocks, though Mike disables most of the animatronics and saves Abby. However, he is attacked by Chica's cupcake and is separated from Abby, who is attacked by Foxy but is saved by Vanessa. Both animatronics are defeated, but as the group try to leave the restaurant, William, revealed to have been posing as \"Steve Raglan\" and having murdered Garrett, appears wearing the now-decaying Spring Bonnie suit, knocks Mike unconscious, and re enables the animatronics.Knowing that they need to understand the truth, Abby begins drawing a picture of William murdering the children, while Vanessa distracts and shoots him but is afterwards stabbed. Abby shows her drawing to the animatronics, causing them to turn on William. Surrounded by the pizzeria's main mascots, part of his suit gets bitten off by the cupcake animatronic, triggering the springlock machinery inside of it and crushing his body as he is dragged into the back room of the restaurant and locked away. Mike and Abby carry a wounded Vanessa out of the restaurant, though she falls into a coma afterwards and is taken to a hospital. Mike continues to look after Abby and they return to their normal lives.In a mid-credits scene, Golden Freddy watches as the dying William bleeds out in the corner, closing the door on him soon after. In a post-credits scene, Balloon Boy is shown appearing inside a taxi driver's car.",

He then goes to a box with a question mark and crushes it, revealing the Super Star. Bowser then boasts that there is nobody who can stop him.In Brooklyn, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are watching a commercial for their new plumbing business. They get mocked by their ex-boss Foreman Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco), but Mario steps in to defend his brother since Luigi is nervous and easily afraid. Moments later, the brothers get a phone call for their first big job. Unfortunately, their van breaks down, forcing them to run across a construction site to make it to their destination.The brothers arrive at the home of a wealthy couple, where Luigi already makes a bad impression when he steps on the toy of the couple's dog, Francis. Mario quickly fixes their leaky faucet, but Francis goes after them. This leads to the bathroom getting more wrecked and Francis nearly falling out the window until Mario and Luigi save him.The two return home where they live with their family and are having pasta with mushrooms (and Mario hates mushrooms). Their parents don't have faith in their plumbing business and write it off as a silly dream, leaving Mario dejected. Luigi goes to comfort his brother, who says he wishes he didn't always feel so small. They then see the news that there is a massive pipe burst in downtown Brooklyn, and Mario thinks only he and Luigi can fix it.Mario and Luigi make it underground as the streets start to get flooded. They find the source of the problem and start to climb their way to the main pipe, but they end up falling deeper into the sewers until they come across a system of pipes. The brothers get pulled in through one of the pipes and are taken through portals, where they are separated.Luigi ends up in The Dark Lands, where he is found by skeletal Koopas called Dry Bones. They chase him until he runs toward a castle where he thinks he is safe until little masked minions (Shy Guys) end up capturing Luigi.Mario ends up in a land full of giant mushrooms. He meets a little mushroom-headed creature, a Toad named...Toad (Keegan-Michael Key). Mario explains to Toad that he got separated from Luigi, and based on his description, Toad figures Luigi is in The Dark Lands. He guides Mario to The Mushroom Kingdom so they can get help.Mario and Toad arrive at the castle of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). She knows Bowser is a threat and is making plans to face off against him with the help of the Kong army after he took the penguins, prisoner. Toad helps Mario sneak into her castle, and Peach is ecstatic to meet another human. Mario asks for her help in finding Luigi, and she says she will once she sees what he is made of.Peach shows Mario an obstacle course that he must go through to prove himself. She does it effortlessly in one go, and she shows him the power-ups that he can use, but unfortunately for Mario, they're mushrooms. He eats one that makes him bigger and stronger, but whenever he gets hit, he loses the power-up. Mario endures hours of falling platforms, man-eating flowers, and wrecking balls. On his last try, he nearly makes it before the flower chomps on him, but it's enough to convince Peach that Mario can help fight Bowser. Peach departs from the Toads as they head to the Kong Kingdom, but they are joined by Toad.Before their journey, Peach demonstrates an ability to Mario to produce fire using a flower. He asks where she came from, but Peach isn't sure. She remembers coming to the Mushroom Kingdom as a lost child, and the Toads raised her before making her their princess.Aboard the Koopa ship, Bowser explains his plan to marry Peach and rule together with her using the Super Star. Later, Bowser sings a piano ballad to himself before Kamek comes in to inform him that Peach has been spotted with Mario, making him super jealous. The Shy Guys bring in Luigi, whom Bowser tortures (yanking his mustache hairs) for information on his brother.Mario, Peach, and Toad arrive at the Kong Kingdom to speak to Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) over gaining his army to fight Bowser, but he refuses. Mario steps up, determined to save Luigi, so Cranky agrees to help on the condition that Mario fight Cranky's son in the arena and win. Mario agrees, despite Peach saying it's a bad idea.In the arena, Mario is pitted against Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). Naturally, the much smaller Mario initially gets whooped by DK, until he starts to take advantage of power-ups. His first attempt goes poorly when he eats a blue mushroom that makes him tiny. He then gets another power-up that gives him a cat suit, which allows him to use cat-like reflexes against Donkey Kong. The ape throws barrels at Mario, but he dodges them and uses his power to punch DK down below, defeating him. Cranky agrees for the Kong army to help Peach.Luigi is imprisoned alongside the penguins and their king (Khary Payton), along with a cheerful (but grim) little star called Lumalee (Juliet Jelenic). Bowser also learns about the Kongs' alliance with Peach, and he plans to stop them.The heroes assemble karts to go after the Koopas. They ride across Rainbow Road to head after them, but Bowser's army ambushes them. The Koopas attack, but Mario and the others are able to fend most of them off. Toad almost falls off but Peach rescues him. A Koopa General (Scott Menville) tries to use his rig to kill Mario, but he avoids the attack and blows up the General's vehicle. The General gets angered and activates his blue shell, performing a kamikaze attack that destroys part of the bridge and sends Mario and Donkey Kong falling into the ocean. The Kongs are captured, and Peach rushes back to the kingdom with Toad to warn everyone.Mario and DK argue as they fall into the water, but DK is knocked out by a falling kart tire. Mario saves him but they are both devoured by a gigantic Maw-Ray. They find a rocket from DK's cart and use it to blast themselves out of its stomach and on their way back to the Mushroom Kingdom.Peach returns to get the Toads to evacuate, but Bowser and his goons show up. He offers his proposal to Peach, who immediately refuses until Bowser orders Kamek to torture Toad. Peach then agrees as long as the Toads are unharmed. Kamek then goes to the other prisoners to announce that they will be sacrificed.The wedding ceremony is about to go off until Bowser presents the sacrifices. Peach then says she was never going to marry him and takes in a blue flower to give herself ice powers. She freezes the mechanism and Bowser while the Toads begin to fight the Koopas. The mechanism breaks apart and the prisoners are lowered further into lava, with Luigi nearly dying first until Donkey Kong arrives, having been powered-up with Mario, to raise them back up. Luigi falls until Mario shows up in a Tanooki outfit that lets him fly. Bowser breaks free from the ice and orders a Bomber Bill to be launched at the Mushroom Kingdom to obliterate it. Mario flies in Bill's eye and gets the giant bomb to chase after him, leading him to the portal pipes where Bill explodes. The ensuing explosion causes everyone in the kingdom to get pulled in.Everyone ends up back in Brooklyn, including the Koopa ship. A now enraged Bowser attacks Mario and beats him down, saying he has no chance to stop him. While Peach and DK try to fight, Mario hides in the pizzeria and sees his commercial with Luigi, inspiring him to keep up the fight. Bowser loses the Super Star, and Mario tries to grab it, but Bowser lets out his fire breath until Luigi steps in to shield Mario with a manhole cover. The two then run to the Star and touch it, making them invincible and powerful, officially becoming THE SUPER MARIO BROTHERS! They plow through the Koopas and proceed to kick Bowser's butt before slamming into him together and annihilating his ship. Now weakened, Peach feeds Bowser a blue mushroom to turn him tiny, and Toad traps him in a jar. Mario and Luigi's parents, the people of Brooklyn, and even Spike cheer for the brothers for saving everyone.Later on, Mario and Luigi continue their plumbing business, only they are now residing in the Mushroom Kingdom. The brothers hop into a portal pipe for another adventure.Mid-Credits Scene: Tiny Bowser tries to sing a song in his cage before Toad tells him to shut up.Post-Credits Scene: In the sewers of Brooklyn, a little egg with green spots begins to hatch, and a little voice calls out...\"Yoshi!\"",

        "synopsis": "In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Roberto, a poor father of two, is approached by a former beauty queen, Gisselle. Gisselle offers to sign his young children, Miguel and Roc\u00edo, to child modeling contracts. He accepts and takes them to the photoshoot. However, when he returns to pick his children up, they are gone. It is revealed that the children were sold to be used as sex slaves.In Calexico, California, Tim Ballard is a Special Agent for the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where he arrests people who possess and distribute child pornography. The painful work takes a great toll on his personal life, and this is only worsened when another agent, Chris, points out that they have arrested many child predators, but have failed to save even a single child from being exploited. Tim explains that this is because most of them are in other countries, but Chris's words stick with him. He speaks to a predator he arrested, Ernst Oshinsky, and pretends to be a pedophile himself. Once he gains Ohinsky's trust, he sets up a meeting with a trafficked child, and is able to arrest the man who purchased the boy, Earl Buchanan.Tim rescues the boy, who says his name is Miguel. Tim befriends the child and asks him for information, hoping to find the other children. Tim learns that Miguel's sister is still missing, and the boy asks him to save her. Tim arranges for Roberto to get his son back, and Roberto breaks down because his daughter is still missing. Miguel and Roberto go home, but not before Miguel gives Tim his sister's Saint Timothy necklace. Tim starts looking for Roc\u00edo, and his search leads him to Cartagena, Colombia. He meets with former Cartel accountant, Vampiro, who now works to save children from sex trafficking.After reading about a child sex club in Thailand that was shut down, Tim decides that this is the perfect cover story to acquire a large number of Gisselle's children in a sting operation. Vampiro gets a Colombian police officer, Jorge, and a wealthy citizen named Paul to help with Tim's mission. Tim's HSI supervisor, Frost, is unable to provide funding for the operation, and asks him to return. Tim, unwilling to abandon the search for Roc\u00edo, resigns. However, Frost is eventually able to convince the Colombian U.S. Embassy to assist with Tim's rescue operation. Undercover, they convince Gisselle to sell them 54 children, successfully arrest all of the conspirators and free the children. However, Roc\u00edo is not with them.After interrogating one of Gisselle's associates, Jorge learns that Roc\u00edo was sold as a slave to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, entrenched deep in the Amazon natural region behind enemy territory. Jorge informs Tim that there is no way to retrieve the girl, because the region is largely unmapped jungle wilderness, and any rebel territory is a no-fly zone for the Colombian government. However, Vampiro suggests that doctors can get into the region for medical purposes, which gives Tim the idea to pose as doctors. Jorge reluctantly agrees to the risky operation. Tim and Vampiro attempt to enter enemy territory in disguise, but the rebels refuse to let both of them enter, leaving Tim to complete the mission alone.Tim successfully gains access to the enemy camp where Roc\u00edo is being held. He learns that she is being used as the personal sex slave for the rebel leader, El Alacr\u00e1n (\"the scorpion\"), and is also being forced to mash coca leaves to produce cocaine to fund the rebel war against the Colombian government. Tim manages to save Roc\u00edo, but is forced to kill El Alacr\u00e1n in the process. Despite being shot at by the rebels, Tim narrowly manages to save Roc\u00edo and gives her the necklace Miguel gave him earlier. Roc\u00edo is finally returned her to her father and brother, and the family returns to Honduras.An epilogue reveals that Tim Ballard never returned to his career in federal law enforcement. He credits his wife with inspiring him to create Operation Underground Railroad, which continues to save children from sexual slavery to this day, and has convinced the United States Congress to pass laws that require the government to cooperate with foreign countries on sex trafficking investigations. The epilogue also states that there are more people enslaved today than in any other time in history, including when slavery was legal. Many of these slaves are children, and the United States is one of the top consumers of child sex slaves.",

        "synopsis": "On Earth-65 in New York City, over a year after helping defeat Kingpin with Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy relates her struggle to create relationships with anyone around her, feeling isolated in her role as Spider-Woman. After quitting her band, she remembers the last person she felt close to, her best friend Peter Parker. He, along with his Aunt May, was very close to Gwen and her father, Police Captain George Stacy, though she never told any of them about her double life as a superhero. Peter was bullied relentlessly at school, despite Gwen trying to defend him. Unbeknownst to her, he started experimenting with a dangerous chemical. The night of prom, a giant lizard monster attacked the school and tried to kill Peter's bully. Gwen, leaping into action as Spider-Woman, fought him off, causing the building to collapse on top of the creature. The lizard reverted to Peter, who was mortally injured by the rubble. Gwen tried to save him, but it was too late. Peter revealed he knew she was Spider-Woman, and reassured her before dying in her arms. Captain Stacy found her over Peter's body and assumed the masked vigilante murdered him, ordering a city-wide manhunt for Spider-Woman. In the present, Gwen returns home to find her dad, who is still determined to bring down the \"killer\" of his daughter's best friend. Despite Gwen telling him it's no good, he soon leaves to respond to a disturbance at the Guggenheim Museum. Gwen is soon behind him as Spider-Woman, neutralizing the cops outside and entering to find a parchment-based version of the Vulture has been sucked into her dimension and is wreaking havoc inside. She is pinned down by the villain, but is saved by another inter-dimensional traveler, Miguel O'Hara, a.k.a. Spider-Man 2099, leader of the Spider Society. He tells her that Vulture, and others like him, have been getting sucked into alternate universes ever since the collider incident in Miles' world. His suit and powers are still struggling to subdue the Renaissance Era Vulture, and he uses his artificial intelligence called Lyla to call for backup in the form of Jessica Drew, another Spider-Woman. Together, the three are able to stop Vulture and save the civilians and cops in the area, though Miguel nearly uses a pair of hidden fangs on the creature. Gwen is out of web and injured, and stops to rest. She is found and cornered by Captain Stacy, who tries to take her in. With no other options, she reveals her identity as his own daughter, to his shock. Despite her trying to reason with him and proclaim her innocence of Peter's death, he continues to place her under arrest. He is stopped by Miguel and Jess, who prepare to take the Vulture back to their dimension. Jess convinces a highly reluctant Miguel not to leave Gwen behind all alone, and he allows her to go with them.Several months later in Brooklyn on Earth-1610, a new small time villain named The Spot tries, unsuccessfully, to rob an ATM using his spots, which create portals whose placement he is unable to control his powers. Miles Morales, a.k.a. Spider-Man, arrives to stop him. He does not take the seemingly harmless criminal seriously, as it seems clear he is incompetent and doesn't want to hurt anyone, though Spot insists that he is Spider-Man's nemesis. Before he can explain, Miles gets frantic texts from his parents, Jefferson and Rio, who are waiting for him at school for a meeting with his principle to discuss his collage future. Miles tries to take down Spot quickly, but the haphazard portals lead to a chaotic chase across the city. Miles eventually subdues Spot, but needs to leave to meet his parents. Miles is doing well enough in school, but some of his grades, and all of his extra curricular activities, have suffered from his unexplained absences. His parents are also concerned that he wants to leave for a collage in New Jersey to help study dimensional travel. He leaves suddenly, seeing that Spot has escaped, and Jeff leaves as well, to Rio's annoyance.Jefferson follows Spider-Man, who is back to fighting Spot, the faceless man feeling insulted that Spider-Man thinks of him as low-tier villain. While teleporting all over, the three of them end up in ruins of the Alchemax collider. The Spot tells Spider-Man that this is where they were both created, as Spot used to be a scientist at Alchemax (the one who Miles threw a bagel at in the first film), and ran the test which brought the spider that bit Miles through from another dimension. Likewise, when Miles destroyed the collider, the energy released caused an accident that turned Spot permanently into the humanoid portal creature his is now. The Spot was shunned by his colleagues, friends, and even family for his condition. He becomes enraged, and tries to attack Spider-Man and Lieutenant Morales, but accidentally kicks himself into a deep portal, which closes behind him. Jeff is frustrated that the criminal got away, as well as all the property damage caused by the fight. He confides in Spider-Man about his struggles to be a good father and husband, and the masked Miles awkwardly offers advice before leaving. The Spot finds himself in a void, where he sees many portals made by his spots. Looking through them, he finds he can travel to different dimensions through them, but loses energy and is unable to return to the in-between space. He determines to find a way to get more power to control the void and defeat Spider-Man.Miles continues to try and balance his life as Miles with his responsibilities as Spider-Man. While late to a big party to celebrate his dad's upcoming promotion to police captain, he stops to get cakes, but is constantly waylaid by Spider-Man duties on his way back, missing his father's speech. When he finally makes it, the cakes are ruined, and his parents confront him about his secretive behavior. Miles becomes frustrated trying to come up with an explanation, and snaps at his parents. Rio and Jeff ground him, and Miles storms off to his room. Gwen suddenly appears through a dimensional portal controlled by a watch given to her by Miguel, and she invites him to hang out. They suit up and Gwen tells him all about Miguel's organization, the Spider Society, which she has joined to help protect the various universes. The two patrol the city for a while before stopping to talk, and Gwen confides in him that he is the only friend she's made since her Peter died, as Miles relates his own struggles with the pressure from his parents. He thinks maybe he should just tell them the truth, but Gwen warns against it. As they get closer, Gwen remarks that in every other universe, a version of Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man, though it always ends in tragedy. Miles optimistically states that there may be a first time for the story to end happily. They return to the party where Gwen shows Miles her dimension jumping watch, which also stabilizes her so she doesn't glitch when she is in other worlds. Miles asks her about joining the Spider Society, but she becomes suddenly closed off about the subject and implies that it's a highly specialized and elite group. Jeff and Rio barge in to meet Gwen, immediately disapproving of her friendship with Miles. Gwen has to leave when her watch indicates to her, and Jeff leaves Rio to talk to Miles. They have a heart to heart talk, but, fearing what Gwen told him, Miles still doesn't reveal he is Spider-Man. Rio gives him her blessing to go after Gwen.Miles suits up and tracks Spider-Gwen to an abandoned and recently damaged building, using his powers to turn invisible and follow her inside. She uses her watch to recreate what happened, seeing that Spot made a miniature collider to give him enough power to dimension hop. Gwen freaks out, and is called by Jess, who is angry that Gwen failed to stop Spot before he escaped. She realizes Gwen disobeyed direct orders to stay away from Miles, though Gwen insists she had to see him. She tells Jess that she will leave Miles' dimension forever, and the older Spider-Woman gives her one last chance to get Spot before she tells Miguel. Lyla tracks him, and Gwen uses her watch to go through a portal. Determined to know more about the Spider Society, and feeling lonely without his friends, Miles jumps in after her. They end up in Earth-50101, Mumbatten, a world where New York is a massive metropolis in India. Miles accidentally runs into Gwen while she is chasing Spot, who has gained a great deal more control over his powers and is evading her easily. Miles also meets the local Spider-Man, Pavitr Prabhakar. Pavitr has only been Spider-Man for six months, but is already a member of the Spider Society. Miles starts to spasm due to being displaced from his universe, like the others did the previous year, and nearly gets Gwen hurt when he tries to save her. The three follow Spot to Earth-50101's Alchemax, which houses a fully functional collider. Spot shuts them out with a forcefield and activates the device. Miles uses his Venom powers to steal the energy from the forcefield, but its is too slow and not strong enough. Another Spider person appears and uses his own powers to smash though the barrier, advising Miles on the proper technique. He is Gwen's friend Hobie Brown, a.k.a. Spider-Punk, a British anti-establishment anarchist spider-man. He joins the others in trying to stop Spot from entering the collider, but are too late. As Spot absorbs the power, Miles sees a vision of his father and another policeman being killed during a battle in the city. Spot, now completely covered by the dark portals and unrecognizable, tells Miles that he will have his revenge for what the teen hero's actions have done to him, and escapes dimensions once again. The building starts to collapse and slide down onto Mumbatten, so the four spider people work together to clear the civilians from harms away. As Pavitr tries to save a bus holding his girlfriend, he sees that her father, Police Inspector Singh, is also in danger. Miles goes to rescue him, but Gwen holds him back, saying its too dangerous. Miles goes anyway, and is just able to save the Inspector, to Pavitr and his girlfriend's relief and gratitude. However, a black portal opens up in the heart of the city, and a transport full of other spider people, including Jess, arrives to contain it. Jess orders Gwen, Hobie, and Miles to return with her to HQ. Miles is happy to be let inside the Spider Society, but Gwen is apprehensive.They are transported to Earth-928, Nueva York, a beautiful futuristic world in the year 2099. They enter the Spider Society Headquarters, where Miles sees hundreds of spider people from all different dimensions, including a virtual reality avatar spider-woman named Spider-Byte, controlled remotely by teenager Margo Kess. Confused as to why Gwen told him it was a small group, Miles is given a wristband to prevent him from glitching out. He also sees \"anomalies\", villains displaced from their own dimensions, who are imprisoned in preparation to be sent home by the Go Home Machine, a device that detects the DNA of the anomalies and sends them to the dimension they came from. They are summoned to see Miguel, and Hobie tells Miles to think carefully about why he wants to be a part of the society, warning him to know what he's fighting for before he accepts their methods. Miguel is furious at Gwen and Miles for letting Spot get away, especially at Miles for interfering. He is interrupted by Peter B. Parker, the Spider-Man who helped Miles the previous year, with his infant daughter Mayday. Gwen takes responsibility, saying she should never have gone to see Miles as she was under orders not to get him involved. Miles want to know what's going on, so Miguel decides to explain the situation to him. He shows him an algorithm containing the details of every universe's Spider-Man, and the things that link each and every one of them together, such as the death of a loved one spurring them to heroism. Miguel explains that these are \"canon events\" that are essential to every spider-man's universe. These events cannot be changed, or else they will break the canon, leading to devastating consequences. Miguel explains that he himself broke the canon when he tried to replace a version of himself that was murdered, in order to raise that version of him's daughter. However, his interference caused that dimension and everyone in it to fade into nothing. There are other details that many spider people share and can be tracked by the algorithm, one of which being a police captain close to Spider-Man getting killed while trying to save a child. This death has been experienced by Peter B. and Jess, as well as Hobie. It was supposed to happen to Captain Singh in Mumbatten, but Miles saved him, causing the black energy to appear and threaten to swallow the entire world. Gwen was trying to stop him to preserve the algorithm's canon. Miles realizes that his dad will soon be made a captain, and the vision from Spot showed the villain causing Jefferson's death while trying to save a child. Miguel confirms that according to their projections, Miles' father will die in two days, when he is sworn in. Miles wants to go save him, but Miguel will not allow him to, saying it is a sacrifice that all spider people must make, and insisting that to damage the canon too much would cause every dimension to be eradicated. The other spider people surround Miles and tell him the same, even Peter B. and Gwen refuse to interfere. Miles rejects the notion that the algorithm knows exactly what will happen if he tries to save his dad, so Miguel entraps him in a force cage, intending to hold him until the canon event has played out. Hobie reminds Miles of his venom powers, and Miles breaks out of the cage and runs for it. Hobie looks on proudly before quitting the Spider Society and returning to his own dimension.Miguel orders every spider person in the skyscraper to catch Miles, but he is able to evade them into the under city. Peter B. finds him and tries to reason with him, saying he only had the courage to become a father because of Miles, and tries to get him to give up for his own sake. Miles refuses to allow his father to die just because Miguel's algorithm says it is meant to happen, and leaves Peter behind when Miguel tracks them from Peter's watch. Miles escapes onto a train bound for the Moon, but Miguel chases him ruthlessly. He catches him, and furiously tells Miles that he could never be a part of the Spider Society, because he is an anomaly himself; The spider that bit Miles was from another dimension. It was never supposed to bite him, and somewhere there is a world with no Spider-Man at all because of it. Peter B. and Gwen catch up, and accidentally reveal that they were aware of this, leaving Miles feeling betrayed by his own friends. Nevertheless, he uses his venom strike to depower Miguel's suit, telling him that he will never give up, and he has now lured all of the spider people away from the headquarters. He leaves Miguel and the others on the train as he turns invisible and escapes back to HQ. He activates the Go Home Machine, which scans his DNA. Miguel tries desperately to stop him but Spider-Byte lets the machine continue, sending Miles away. Miguel is livid, and orders Jess and Ben, a.k.a. Scarlet Spider, to come with him and hunt Miles down. Gwen questions Miguel in front of everyone, arguing that maybe Miles is right, and perhaps Spider-Man 2099's algorithm doesn't know for certain what will happen if the canon is broken. Miguel uses to Go Home Machine to banish Gwen back to her own dimension. Peter B. and Mayday return to Earth-616 to find his wife, Mary Jane, waiting for them. Peter wonders if he is going to be any good at raising a child after all, but Mary Jane reassures him.Miles arrives in New York, and Gwen is dropped off in Earth-65. Miguel, Scarlet, and Jessica also teleport to New York. Gwen tries desperately to return and find Miles, but her watch has been deactivated. She goes to her apartment to grab her things, but is found by her dad. They finally talk, Gwen explaining why she felt she could never tell him about her alter ego, and George tells her that he is quitting the police force. Gwen realizes that means he will no longer be a captain, and they reconcile. George gives Gwen a package left by Hobie, containing a homemade dimension watch made from parts stolen from the Spider Society. Gwen uses it to jump back to Miles' Earth.Jess, Miguel, and Ben split up to look for Miles, meanwhile Miles is racing through to city to his apartment, contemplating everything the other spider people have told him. He makes it back to his bedroom safely, and is found by his mom. Miles embraces her, rambling about everything that has happened to him since leaving. He decides he will not be afraid anymore, and tells her that he's Spider-Man. Rio, however, doesn't know who Spider-Man is, and goes about her evening. Miles starts to spasm from dimensional displacement, as Gwen arrives at Miles' empty bedroom in Earth-1610. Miles realizes that the Go Home Machine sent him to the dimension the spider who bit him came from: Earth-42. Aaron Davis, Miles' uncle, shows up, still alive in this world, but there is no sign of Jeff, and Rio is working overtime to try and provide for her and her son. Aaron takes Miles with him up to the roof, asking him if he remembers \"the plan\". As they exit, Miles takes in this version of New York, a crime-ridden, villain ruled, dangerous landscape, and sees that his father has already been killed in this universe. Miles remembers that Earth-42 has no Spider-Man. Aaron gets a text, and before Miles can react, he is knocked unconscious by and unknown figure. Gwen hears Mr. and Mrs. Morales worriedly talking in the other room, and they discuss their feeling of alienation from their son. Gwen appears and tells them it is her fault he has not returned, gaining some respect from Jeff when he learns that her father is a cop. She leaves to find Miles, and Rio asks her to remind him of their love for him when she does.Miles comes to, tied up in Aaron's apartment. he tries to explain that he is from another universe, one where his father is alive and Aaron is dead. He appeals to Aaron's better nature, saying his uncle never truly wanted to be the Prowler. Aaron tells Miles that he isn't the Prowler, but shows him the person who is: Earth-42's Miles Morales. Prowler Miles is fascinated by his story, and Miles pleads with his counterpart to release him so he can save their father. However, Prowler Miles has no intention of letting him go.Gwen puts together her own team to find and rescue Miles, including Hobie, Pavitr, Margo, Peter B. and Mayday, Peni Parker and her robot SP//dr, Spider-Man Noir, and Spider-Ham. As they use Hobie's homemade portals to start their mission, Miles starts to charge up his venom.",

        "synopsis": "A next-generation Russian stealth submarine Sevastopol employs an advanced AI, activated by a two-piece cruciform key. The submarine is under Bering strait, and the Russian Navy is testing the AI system to help evade enemy submarines. So far, the system has performed miraculously, and the submarine has deliberately approached every navy in the world and remained undetected. The AI system is enclosed within a fortified done housed within the submarine.\nThe AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. The flooded submarine, along with the fortified dome housing the AI system sits at the bottom of the Bering strait. The bodies of the 2 officers with the 2 parts of the key, floats to the surface.Ethan Hunt is assigned the task to retrieve the key, one half of which is with Isla Faust.\nIMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert and successfully retrieves a key piece from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). He also fakes her death to ensure she survives a bounty of $50 million placed by an unknown source.Back in Washington, D.C., he infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger (Cary Elwes) discussing the AI, known as the \"Entity\" (Simon Pegg).\nCIA director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) states the Entity achieved sentience and can manipulate cyberspace, allowing it to control global defense intelligence and financial networks. It has infiltrated all major defense systems globally and has not done anything. It sent a very clear message that it can return anytime and assume control. The CIA does not know the goal of the Entity. The Entity now resides in the cloud.\nNow it is infiltrating all intelligence networks around the world and corrupting their data. Governments are taking physical backups of their files before they are lost to the Entity. The Entity would know every weakness of every country, network, system out there. The servers have been isolated from the outside world, but the Entity has managed to bribe and blackmail humans to infiltrate the servers and continue towards its goal.World powers compete to obtain the cruciform key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown. Kittridge says that a buyer is passing through the Middle East in the next 72 hours and already has one half of the key.\nKittridge tells Denlinger that the other half of the Key was with Ilsa, and he had sent his agent to retrieve the key from her.Revealing himself, Ethan converses with Kittridge and deduces that Kittridge placed Ilsa's bounty. Ethen refuses to give the half key to Kittridge and states his intention to destroy the Entity, knowing they would be considered rogue actors and are participating in a global race.\nEthan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the buyer of the other key piece while evading US agents led by Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham). Ethan's plan was to sell their half of the key to the buyer, and then follow the buyer to figure out what it unlocks.\nEthan locates the buyer at Abu Dhabi airport and follows him to his flight to Venice.During the pursuit, the key piece is stolen by a professional thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell). Ethan confronts Grace and offers to put the key back in the buyer's pocket in exchange for a generous payment of $4 million. But the buyer was already dead and the key that Grace stole was a counterfeit. Which means that someone had manipulated Ethan to be at the airport with the real key.\nConcurrently, Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device, which was headed to the same flight as the buyer and Ethan. While Ethan was distracted, Grace steals the real key from Ethan.\nEthan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel (Esai Morales), a sadistic Entity liaison with ties to his Pre-IMF past. Gabriel is a powerful terrorist and Ethan's adversary who appears to be working with the Entity. He and Ethan had a fateful encounter with each other prior to Ethan becoming an IMF agent.Aborting the mission, the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome. She is apprehended upon arrival but Ethan rescues her from local authorities, US agents, and an Entity operative named Paris (Pom Klementieff). Paris pursues Ethan and Grace and kills many US agents and Roman police along the way, but they still manage to escape by working together. Grace had revealed to Ethan that she was delivering the key to a party in Venice.\nGrace escapes again, while Ethan rendezvous with Luther, Benji, with Ilsa rejoining them. With Benji and Luther providing support, Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace to Venice where they infiltrate a party held by the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), also known as the White Widow.\nLuther had figured out by analyzing the video feed from the airport that Gabriel is working for the Entity and was most probably the person who planted the bomb. Ilsa says that Gabriel is the Entity's messenger and that the key leads to the Entity's source code. But it was Ilsa's friends at MI6 who shared this information with her digitally.\nEthan suspects that the Entity is manipulating their actions and there is a reason why it has assembled all his dear friends in Venice. But the 4 agree that they cannot let Gabriel have the complete key.All groups, Alanna, Gabriel, Ethan, Grace, Ilsa gather at the party. Ethan realizes that the party was organized by the Entity as well. All groups disclose their role in acquiring the complete key. Grace was hired by Alanna to steal the other key piece to produce the completed key, which will be sold to her buyer the next day on the Orient Express. Ethan knows that Alanna doesn't want to keep the key for herself as she does not know what it unlocks. Alanna cannot decide whether to give the key to her friend Ethan, or to Gabriel and put her fate in his hands.Through the Entity, Gabriel proclaims he will possess the completed key the next day and that either Ilsa or Grace will die. Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to escape. Ethan pursues Grace (as she still has one half of the key), but the Entity hacks into their communications and impersonates Benji, leading him away from Grace and into a fight with Paris, whom he spares.Concurrently, The Entity leads Grace and Isla to Gabriel. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Grace and Ethan, who vows vengeance. Thus, Grace agrees to impersonate Alanna and take the key during the sale. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to prevent interference from the Entity, advising Ethan to spare Gabriel to determine information about the Entity. Luther says that the Entity knows that Ethan is the only one who wants to kill the Entity, which is why it used Gabriel to kill Ilsa, so Ethan would be provoked to kill Gabriel and with him all knowledge about what the key unlocks.The next day, on the train, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. Grace infiltrates the train impersonating Alanna and gets her half of the key.\nWith Paris, Gabriel meets Denlinger, who divulges information only he knows in an attempt to form an alliance between himself and the Entity.Originally an advanced cyber weapon developed by the US, the Entity went rogue following its deployment against the Sevastopol (The US deployed an early copy of the on the submarine to sabotage her stealth capability). Meanwhile, outside, the AI evolved and rewrote itself, becoming the Entity. So, inside the submarine is the only remaining copy of the AI's original source code which can be used to control or destroy it.\nThe completed key unlocks a chamber inside the vessel containing the Entity's source code, allowing it to be destroyed or controlled. Gabriel subsequently kills Denlinger and tries to kill Paris as the Entity determined she would betray them after Ethan spared her life.\nImpersonating Alanna, Grace brings the key to Kittridge, revealed to be the buyer, and negotiates a $100 million sale alongside protection for herself, but pickpockets the key from Kittridge after canceling the transfer. Ethan parachutes into the train to save Grace, but Gabriel acquires the key.Ethan and Gabriel fight atop the train, but Gabriel escapes and detonates a bridge ahead. Grace and Ethan detach the locomotive from the rest of the train, saving the passengers. Paris rescues both from falling and manages to tell Ethan the key's connection to the Sevastopol before losing consciousness. Grace informs Kittridge of her desire to join the IMF.Ethan flees the wreckage by para-glider with the completed key, which he took from Gabriel during the fight, and rendezvous with Benji to continue the mission, which is finding the Sevastopol and destroying the Entity.",

Cole breaks down the door and retrieves an injured Duckett, before taking him into the living room where Duckett stabs his brother in the chest and then himself in the face, killing himself in front of the party-goers.Meanwhile, 17-year-old Mia is struggling with the second anniversary of her mother Rhea's suicide and her distant relationship with her father, Max. Mia, her best friend Jade and Jade's little brother Riley sneak out to a house party hosted by Hayley and Joss where the main attraction is the severed, embalmed hand of a powerful medium, which they use to conjure spirits by lighting a candle and saying the phrase \"talk to me,\" before proceeding to say \"I let you in\" for full possession, and blowing out the candle once ninety seconds has passed. Mia volunteers to go first, and is possessed by a spirit that threatens Riley before Joss and Hayley rip the hand away and blow out the candle, bringing Mia back to her normal self.Mia, ecstatic over the feeling the hand brought her, along with Hayley, Joss and Jade's boyfriend Daniel all gather at Jade's house the next night, where Riley volunteers to play the game, only to be possessed by Rhea's spirit, who attempts to reconcile with Mia. The time limit is exceeded and Riley's body is overtaken by the spirits, repeatedly smashing his face against the table and causing him to be hospitalized. Mia, now haunted by visions of Rhea, is turned away by Jade and her mother Sue, who blame her for Riley's injuries. Seeking comfort from Daniel, Mia invites him to sleep over, but she assaults him after she's possessed by a spirit, causing Daniel to leave and Mia to realize that the spirits have followed them. Having secretly taken the embalmed hand from Jade's house, Mia uses it to contact Rhea, who tells her that her death was purely accidental and that she needs to help Riley, who is evidently still possessed after he attacks Jade at the hospital and violently self-harms in front of her.Mia, Jade, Daniel, Hayley and Joss track down Cole, who reveals that Joss was the one to give Duckett the hand leading to his death, and that Riley's body will inevitably kick the spirits out. Mia deduces that they need to complete the ritual by blowing out the candle, which they failed to do the first time, to save Riley, but they are only able to contact the spirit of a little girl in the hospital who shows Mia a vision of Riley being tortured in limbo. Mia returns home, where Max reveals that Rhea's death was not accidental, and reads her a suicide note that he had hidden from her to prevent her from blaming herself, causing Mia to retreat to her room where Rhea's spirit tells her that Max is lying before she is attacked by a hallucination of Max. Max arrives just as the vision disappears, and Mia inadvertently stabs her father in the neck with a pair of scissors.After being told by Rhea that Riley needs to die in order to be set free, Mia tricks Jade and Sue into leaving the hospital and enters Riley's room, where he takes the appearance of a rotting spirit, but finds herself unable to kill him. Jade arrives at Mia's house where she finds a bleeding Max before returning to the hospital just as Mia leaves with Riley in a wheelchair toward the highway. The spirits attempt to convince Mia to push Riley into oncoming traffic, but coming to her senses and realizing this would hand him over to the spirit realm completely, Mia instead jumps in front of a car herself, saving Riley who is then rescued by Jade.An injured Mia is suddenly transported to the hospital, where she sees a fully healed Riley waking up with his family. As she attempts to reach her father, he leaves in an elevator and she is engulfed in darkness, ending up trapped in limbo. She finds herself on the other side of the embalmed hand while foreign party-goers play the game and summon her spirit.",

        "synopsis": "At a secluded winery in Sicily, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) kills crime enforcer Lorenzo Vitale (Bruno Bilotta) and his henchmen to obtain a key to the winery's vault and recoup money stolen in a cyber-heist. While leaving the winery, Robert is shot in the back by Vitale's adolescent grandson. Robert considers suicide due to his injury, but finds his gun out of bullets and then takes the ferry to go back to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, Robert pulls over and slips into unconsciousness from shock, where he is found and rescued by Gio Bonucci (Eugenio Mastrandrea), a local Carabiniere.Bonucci brings him to a remote coastal Italian town called Altamonte, where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). Robert gets acquainted with the locals and becomes fond of the town and its people. Robert makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) to tip her off about the winery's role in the illegal drug trade disguised as normal business transactions in Sicily. Collins and other CIA operatives arrive at the winery and find millions in cash along with bags of Fenethylline tablets hidden in a storeroom, confirming Robert's suspicions.Meanwhile, the members of the Camorra harass and kill villagers in an attempt to coerce them out of their housing and take over Altamonte for commercialization purposes. Robert overhears Marco Quaranta (Andrea Dodero), a high-ranking Camorra member, pressurizing local store owner Angelo (Daniele Perrone) for payments. To make an example, the Camorra firebombs Angelo's fish store as the entire town watches. Bonucci reviews video of the firebombing and calls the Italian central police for an inquiry. Along with his wife and daughter, Bonucci is later attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations.\nMeanwhile Collins has tracked Robert to Altamonte and knows that Robert was behind the killings at the vineyard. Robert wants Collins to find why Lorenzo was using Silicy as his base for the drug smuggling operations from Middle East into Europe. As such, Silicy is the most heavily guarded port in the region.Sometime after, Marco demands that Bonucci set up a boat for them; overhearing them, Robert requests them to move their operations to a different location. When Marco refuses, Robert kills him and his henchmen.\nMeanwhile a Rome station is bombed by Syrian terrorists, and Collins finds that the drug money from Lorenzo was funding their activities in Italy. She figures that the Syrians are in Sicily and hence were routing the drugs through that Island.\nWith the help of the local police, Collins starts hunting down cells of terrorists on Sicily.The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Vincent (Andrea Scarduzio), Marco's brother and head of the Camorra, to find the person behind Marco's death. The Head of Police knew that Vincent was buying the drugs from the Syrians and funding their attacks on his own people. He tells Vincent about Collins who is soon going to figure out Vincent's operations.Vincent has Collins' car rigged with a bomb, but she survives after Robert warns her.\nVincent later threatens to shoot Bonucci in front of the entire town if Robert does not reveal himself. Robert does, but before Vincent can kill him, the citizens begin to record the ordeal, causing Vincent and the rest of the Camorra to retreat with plans to retaliate the following day.Later that night, Robert infiltrates Vincent's home and stealthily kills his bodyguards. Then, Robert forces Vincent to take a lethal dose of his own drugs to kill him. Through Collins, Robert returns the money he had taken from the winery to an elderly couple's pension fund. This couple's pension fund was hacked and the money stolen by Lorenzo.\nBack in Langley, Virginia, Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. She receives a package containing a book of contacts and note from Robert congratulating her, and declaring her mother would be proud of her - revealing Collins to be the daughter of Robert's longtime friend and colleague Susan Plummer. With the Quaranta brothers dead, Robert celebrates with the locals after their football team's victory.",
        "plot": "Robert McCall finds himself at home in Southern Italy but he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia."

        "synopsis": "Kazunori Yamauchi (Takehiro Hira), is the creator of Gran Turismo, the most accurate racing simulator of all time. Kanzunori wanted to make racing accessible to all.Following a pitch by marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), Nismo, the motor-sport division of Nissan establishes the GT Academy to recruit skilled players of the racing simulator Gran Turismo and turn them into real racing drivers. Danny believes that 80 million youth play the Gran Tourismo. If he can convert one of them into a racing champion, that would open up a whole new category for their physical cars.Danny recruits former driver-turned-mechanic Jack Salter (David Harbour) to train the players. Jack is initially hesitant but accepts after tiring of the arrogance of his team's driver, Nicholas Capa (Josha Stradowski). Jack believes that putting a kid from behind his console into a 200 mile an hour rocket is dangerous, but Danny is convinced that the kids have more track time than any of the professional racers.\nMeanwhile, Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), a teenage clothing store employee and gamer from Cardiff, Wales, is an avid player of the simulator and wants to become a racing driver, despite the disapproval of his former footballer father Steve Mardenborough (Djimon Hounsou). Jann argues that racing cars is what he is good at, it's what he loves.One day, Jann learns he is eligible for a qualification race to join the GT Academy after setting a time record for a particular track. The night before his race, Jann is invited by his brother Coby to a party, and the brothers take their father's car. Jann flirts with a young woman named Audrey (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) whom he develops a crush on.\nThe gathering is disbanded after police arrive, and Jann initiates a pursuit after driving away when their friends are pulled over. The brothers escape but are caught returning by their father. Coby (Daniel Puig) starts to worry, but Jann offers to take the blame for him if he admits that he is the better driver. Jann is taken to his father's place of employment the next morning in an attempt to be taught a life lesson (Steve says that either Jann gets an education, or he joins Steve at the rail-yard since he has no other plans. Steve says that there is no future in racing), but leaves early to partake in the qualifying race, which he wins, earning a place in GT Academy.At the academy camp in Silverstone UK, Jack puts the competitors (Including Jann, Matty, Antonio, Frederick, Leah Vega (Emelia Hartford), Joo-Hwan Lee (Sang Heon Lee), Klaus Hoffman (Max Mundt), Henry Evas (Mariano Gonz\u00e1lez), Avi Bhatt (Harki Bhambra), Chloe McCormick (Lindsay Pattison), Marcel Durand (Th\u00e9o Christine))through their paces in various tests, through which ten competitors are narrowed down to five.\nDuring one of which, Jann crashes with Jack in the car and claims the brakes were glazed, later proven correct by analysts, to Jack's surprise. The remaining five compete in a final race to determine who will represent Nissan. Jann narrowly wins the race against American competitor Matty Davis (Darren Barnet), but Danny insists Matty should be chosen as the representative due to his better commercial viability and due to Jann not being press ready and awkward in front of the camera. However, Jann is chosen at Jack's insistence.Jann is told that if he finishes at least fourth in any one of a series of qualifying races, he will earn a professional license and contract with Nissan. He finishes last in his first professional race in Austria after Nicholas taps him into a spin, and despite gradually improving over the next few races, he does not finish the penultimate race in Spain. He travels to Dubai for his last qualifying race, during which Nicholas takes a corner too fast and crashes. Despite the debris from this crash cracking his windshield, Jann achieves a fourth-place finish and earns his license. He then travels to Tokyo with Danny and Jack to sign his contract and uses his signing bonus to fly Audrey to Tokyo. During this time, they initiate a relationship.Jann's first race after signing is at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. He starts the race well and maintains a high position until the front of his car lifts into the air at the Flugplatz corner, hitting a barrier and launching into a crowded spectator area. Jann is airlifted to the N\u00fcrburgring Medical Center and is informed while in hospital that a spectator was killed in the crash, much to his horror. Reluctant to return to racing and blaming himself for the spectator's death, Jack takes him back to the N\u00fcrburgring, during which he reveals he was involved in a fatal accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which led to a fellow driver dying and his retirement from driving.\nAn inquiry clears Jann of any wrongdoing, but professional sentiment begins to turn against sim drivers. In response, Danny decides a sim driver team should compete at Le Mans and finish on the podium to prove their viability.Danny enlists Matty and fellow GT Academy participant Antonio Cruz (Pepe Barroso) to make up the three-driver team alongside Jann. On race day, Jann's father apologizes for not initially being supportive of his passions. Early in the race, Jann is left shaken after Frederik Schulin's (Niall McShea) car crashes and catches fire, but is encouraged through his first shift by Jack playing \"Songbird\" and \"Orinoco Flow\" through the car's communication system, which Jann had previously used as motivational music during training.\nMatty and Antonio complete their first shifts without issue, but the latter is brought in from his last session early due to experiencing cramps. A wheel nut is dropped by mechanic Felix (Richard Cambridge) during the pit stop, causing Jann to lose several positions. He deviates from advised racing lines he learned from playing Gran Turismo to regain his positions, breaking the competition lap record in the process. The final lap sees Jann pitted against Nicholas, with Jann once again narrowly in front on the final straight to earn third place and a podium finish for Nissan.In the epilogue, the real Jann Mardenborough is shown having competed in over 200 races and served as his own stunt double in the film.",
        "plot": "Based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of a team of underdogs - a struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec - who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world."

While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death, all the while Jacques watches as he holds onto the priest's rosary.Following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has made friends with a young Irish girl named Sophie, as well as a teacher and her mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him, and the next day, she is asked by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe. While Irene travels to Tarascon, Sister Debra, a young novice, joins her without permission. During the train ride, Debra expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, while Irene explains to her the importance of faith.At Tarascon, Irene has a vision where she follows Jacques into an alley but ends up getting choked by Valak, the demon who takes the form of a nun. The next morning, Debra tells Irene that she had met with Jacques and he had given her Father Noiret's rosary. At the same time, in the boarding school, Sophie is bullied by her classmates and locked up in the abandoned chapel of the school where no-one is allowed to enter. The bullies tell her to look at a window with a goat on the mosaic, and claim that if she looks away, the devil will appear to haunt her. The sun shines through the mosaic and makes the eye of the goat shine red.Irene and Debra travel to Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian who tells them that the demon they are investigating was an angel rejected by God and that the emblem on the rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire by the pagan, she miraculously did not die; St. Lucy's family rescued her eyes and dispersed throughout the world. The librarian suggests that the demon is killing the descendants of St. Lucy because it wants this relic, the eyes, which were last known to be stored in a former monastery, which is revealed to be a boarding school in the present day.Irene and Debra go to the school to find Maurice in distress with Sophie and Kate. Irene tells Maurice that the demon is inside of him, and is devastated by the revelation, but is then taken over by the demon and attacks Irene and Debra, before being knocked unconscious. Inside the chapel of the school, Sophie shows Irene, Debra, and Kate the game her classmates made her play and Debra uses a flashlight to make the eyes of the goat on the mosaic glow red. The red light points in the direction of where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried and Irene finds the relic.Debra and Kate are separated from Irene and Sophie to protect the schoolgirls from a demon goat. Under the influence of the demon, Maurice escapes and attacks Irene, while Sophie grabs the relic and runs away. Maurice chases after Sophie and causes the bell tower building to collapse. Irene finds Sophie inside, and Debra reunites with the pair. Debra admits that she has seen a miracle and has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice until he manages to hold it himself. He lifts Irene in the air and sets her on fire, but she does not burn as she realizes that she is a descendant of St. Lucy and is able to harness the same power associated with the relic.Irene and Debra begin to pray the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and barrels of wine present at the former monastery become the blood of Christ. As the blood of Christ soaks Valak, the demon perishes and is damned back to hell.",

        "synopsis": "In 1944, Nazis capture Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and Oxford archaeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) as they attempt to retrieve the Lance of Longinus (the blade that drew Christ's blood) from a castle in the French Alps. Indiana manages to escape when an Allied bomb falls on the bell tower where he was being hanged.The allied forces were converging on France and Colonel Weber was in the process of moving all the loot to Berlin on a special train commissioned for this purpose. Basil is loaded on this train and interrogated about the Lance. Basil says that the Lance had no power, and he and Indiana were only trying to save some history.Astrophysicist Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) informs his superior Colonel Weber (Thomas Kretschmann) that the Lance is fake, but he has found half of Archimedes' Dial, an Antikythera mechanism built by the ancient Syracusan mathematician Archimedes which reveals time fissures, allowing for possible time travel. Basil witnesses this exchange between Voller and Weber.Indy escapes onto a Berlin-bound train filled with looted antiquities and frees Basil. He obtains the Dial piece from Voller and knocks him unconscious, and the two leap from the train just before Allied forces derail it. At the time Indiana did not know the significance of the Dial and Basil never told him what he had learned from Voller.Twenty-five years later, in 1969, Indy is retiring from Hunter College in New York City. His wife, Marion (Karen Allen), has recently filed for legal separation after their son Mutt (Shia LaBeouf ) was killed in the Vietnam War.\nIndy is teaching a class on how Rome invaded Syracuse in Sicily in 213 BC. Archimedes was a brilliant mathematician and an inventor in Syracuse who devised a solution to use concave mirrors to harness the sun's heat to set the Roman armada on fire. The Antikythera is the only real proof from history that all of this ever happened.Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), Indy's goddaughter, visits him and wants to research the Dial. Helena still believes that the Dial is back in the French Alps and wants Indy's help to find it. Indy warns that her deceased father, Basil, became obsessed with studying the Dial before relinquishing his half to Indy to destroy, which he never did.\nIndy tells Helena that Basil believed that Archimedes had figured that the movement of the moon and the planets were not regular. And those irregularities could case fissures in time, and the dial was an instrument built by Archimedes to predict those fissures.It is the time of the moon landing, and the city of New York is celebrating the return of its Astronauts from the moon. Voller is in New York as well, and he is one of the scientists who worked on the rocket who put the Americans on the moon.\nVoller still smarts from the German loss in WW II and says that Hitler lost the war due to his ego. Voller is with a team of agents (Hauke (Olivier Richters) and Klaber (Boyd Holbrook)) & a CIA agent Mason (Shaunette Renee Wilson) who are looking for Helena.As Indy and Helena retrieve the Dial half from the college archives, Voller's accomplices attack them. The CIA assists Voller, now working for NASA on the Apollo program. Helena, revealed as an antiquities smuggler, absconds with the Dial to auction it on the black market.\nIndy is framed for two colleagues' murders, forcing him to escape through both the New York ticker-tape parade for the crew of Apollo 11 and an anti-war protest. He seeks out old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), now a New York cab driver.\nMeanwhile Voller abandons the CIA agents and goes after Helena with Klaber and Hauke. He charters a private plane to Morocco.Sallah surmises Helena will likely auction the Dial in Tangier as she was arrested there earlier, then helps Indy flee the country. On the flight, Indy studies all of Basil's notes on the Dial. Indy remembers the night he took the dial from Basil, when Basil had told him that Archimedes had figured out a way to predict temporal fissures. Indy had laughed it off.At a Tangier hotel, Indy disrupts Helena's illegal private auction, but Voller and his henchmen arrive and steal the artifact. Indy, Helena, and her teen sidekick, Teddy Kumar (Ethann Isidore), chase them through the streets in a Tuk-Tuk. The CIA intercepts Voller after the U.S. government disavows him for going rogue (Mason tells Voller that the US Government never cared about the Dial and only agreed to help Voller to keep him happy. But his rogue actions and those of his associates has dented his credibility and Mason refuses to take him anywhere other than back to the US), but his cohorts murder the agents and steal their helicopter.Indy knows that the tablet containing instructions to the other half of the Dial is in the Aegean Sea, as Syracuse was surrounded by Romans, and Archimedes never had time to put it anywhere else. Helena has the coordinates and Indy has friends who can help them get there.\nIndy, Helena, and Teddy trail Voller to Greece and team up with Indy's old friend, Renaldo (Antonio Banderas), a professional sea diver.\nGuided by Basil's research, they dive to an ancient Aegean Sea shipwreck (it was a Roman ship that Helena speculates was carrying the Grafikos and one half of the Dial and was looking for the 2nd half. The 1st Half of the Dial was recovered from this wreck, but the majority of the ship was resting on the Ocean floor, another 100 feet down which was not accessible back then. Helena believes this is where the Grafikos is) and retrieve a \"Grafikos\" tablet containing directions to the Dial's other half. Helena asks Indy where in history he would go if he got the dial, to which he tearfully replies, back to stop Mutt from enlisting to fight in Vietnam, thus preventing Mutt's death and the disintegration of his and Marion's marriage.\nVoller arrives and takes over Renaldo's boat. The Grafikos tablet has a message written in Polybius Cypher, which Voller cannot understand. He forces Indy to decipher the tablet by killing Renaldo. Helena offers to decipher the tablet for $100,000. Helena translates the instructions to the tomb of Archimedes which has been undiscovered for 2000 years.\nIndy's group escapes and heads to Sicily, pursued by Voller. Turns out Helena had misguided Voller, the tomb was not in Alexandria, but in Sicily.Inside the Ear of Dionysius cavern, Indy and Helena find Archimedes' tomb and the Dial's second half. The pair also discover a 20th-century wristwatch on Archimedes' skeleton and a carving of a phoenix with propellers on his tomb. Voller appears (as he had seen the group heading West and not East to Alexandria) and captures Indy, wounding him. Helena and Teddy escape and chase Voller.\nAfter reassembling the Dial, Voller reveals his plans to time travel back to 1939 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and help lead Germany to victory in World War II. Voller and his team change into their Nazi uniforms to prepare for their time travel.\nAt an airfield, Voller activates the Dial and locates a time fissure in the sky. Indy is held captive on Voller's stolen plane (which is also painted in Nazi colors) while Helena stows away through its landing gear. Teddy follows them in another plane.While approaching the fissure, Indy realizes that continental drift could have altered the time-line coordinates. Rather than 1939, the group arrives at the Siege of Syracuse in 214 BC. The warring armies shoot down Voller's plane, believing it is a dragon.\nIndy and Helena parachute out just before the plane crashes, killing everyone aboard, while Teddy lands safely. Archimedes investigates the crash and finds Voller's body, wristwatch, and the Dial in the wreckage.\nArchimedes tells Indy and Helena that he created the Dial to bring users from the future through fissures that lead only to his time, in order to obtain their assistance in the battle against the overwhelming Roman force. As the fissure begins to collapse, a wounded Indy decides to remain behind, feeling he has nothing to return to. Helena, fearing a time paradox and unwilling to give up on him, knocks Indy unconscious.Back in the present, a recovering Indy awakens in his apartment. Helena, Teddy, Sallah, and Marion are there as well. After everyone else leaves, Indy and Marion reconcile.",

        "synopsis": "Peter is in depression ever since Gamora lost her memory from the last few years.At their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her. Adam easily defeats Rocket, Mantis, Peter Nebula and Groot. Kraglin's arrows cannot pierce Adam's metallic skin. Even Drax is no match for Adam's strength and is subdued.After critically wounding Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Adam is stabbed by Nebula (Karen Gillan), and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are useless at healing Rocket's wounds, who has a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company led by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), Rocket's creator. The code on Rocket's kill switch is 89P13.\nThe Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life. Kraglin is left in charge of Knowhere with Cosmos, whom Kraglin considers an ugly dog.As Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. He was found as a baby raccoon and was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, an alien cyborg scientist and CEO of OrgoCorp specializing in creating hybrid creatures and Rocket's creator, seeking to forcibly enhance all living beings into a \"special race\" where he has been credited as creating the Animen, the Humanimals, the Hell Spawn, the Sovereign, the Xeronians, and the Star Children, to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth.\nRocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla (Linda Cardellini), the walrus Teefs (Asim Chaudhry), and the rabbit Floor (Mikaela Hoover).\nThe High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's growing intelligence and used his insight to fix a defect in later Humanimal batches but planned to harvest Rocket's brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89.\nThe High Evolutionary shows Rocket how he has perfected programmed evolution, but for some reason, the evolved organisms are violent by nature. Rocket is able to point out specific changes to the evolutionary program that would help control the level of violence tendency in the evolved organisms.After making the suggested changes, the programmed evolution sequence works. The High Evolutionary is amazed that Rocket, from batch 89, was able to figure this technology out, but could not figure out that batch 89 was only an experiment and not meant for the New World he was building.\nRocket attempted to free his friends, before the High Evolutionary killed Lylla and mocked Rocket for showing grief over her death. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary's face, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket fled in a spaceship.Back in the present, Ayesha is shown to be working for the High Evolutionary. High Evolutionary is livid with Ayesha for knowing of 89P13's existence for several years without alerting him. High Evolutionary wants 89P13 returned to him, else he promises to wipe out Ayesha's entire Sovereign race.The Ravagers (The Ravagers are an interstellar criminal syndicate that specialize in thievery, trafficking and piracy. There were nearly one hundred factions of Ravagers around the galaxy. Each faction has a captain of its own, leading their operations), including an alternate version of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp.\nPeter tries to get Gamora to remember their life together, but she says that it was some future version of her, and not her who fell in love with Peter. Gamora also points out that the things Peter loves, it sounds like he is in love with Nebula.\nOrgocorp is completely made of organic material. Gamora gets them in via a decompression chamber, but the group is soon discovered.\nThey retrieve Rocket's file and fight off Orgacorp sentries to be picked up Groot who flies in with their spaceship.\nThe group discover that the code to override the kill switch was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel (Nico Santos), one of the High Evolutionary's advisers. High Evolutionary has used Orgocorp to fund his experiments that lie outside Inter-Galactic law.The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him.\nGamora argues that this is a trap since the High Evolutionary is looking for Rocket and they are taking him straight to the High Evolutionary. Gamora signals the Ravagers to pick her up, but her communication is intercepted by Ayesha, who follows the Guardians with Adam.The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Arete Laboratories complex. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) remain with Gamora and Rocket, while Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Nebula travel to Arete. Nebula is forced to wait outside the complex by guards as she is armed; Quill and Groot enter Arete to meet the High Evolutionary, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group.\nAs Quill's group is engaged in banter by the High Evolutionary, he launches an attack by his guards on Quill's ship to retrieve Rocket.\nGamora saves Rocket from being captured by Adam and the High Evolutionary's guard War Pig (Judy Greer). Adam kills War Pig as he wanted to present Rocket to the High Evolutionary and save the Sovereign.Questioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits this version Counter-Earth's society is imperfect, so he bombards the planet, killing the Humanimals as well as Ayesha. This enrages Adam who considered Adam as his mother. Adam's ship is destroyed and he has no option but to take shelter with Gamora.Arete departs as a spaceship, with Nebula, Drax and Mantis boarding it to rescue Quill and Groot, who instead escape Arete with Theel, who they kill before retrieving the code from his corpse and being rescued by Gamora in their ship.\nAs Quill's group uses the code, Rocket flat-lines and has a near-death experience, in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. He learns from Lylla that his time has not yet come, as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and restart Rocket's heart.Drax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter several genetically modified humanoid children on Arete before being captured by the High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary wants Peter to bring Rocket to him in exchange for the captured trio. Peter contacts Kraglin on the Knowhere to help.\nThe High Evolutionary tells his advisers that in thousands of generations that he created, only one experiment led to true intelligence and that was Rocket, which is studying him is critical.The other Guardians stage a rescue, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces.\nKraglin (Sean Gunn) fires on Arete with Knowhere, dooming Arete. Kraglin and Cosmos then help to save Knowhere's citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Cosmos is revealed to have Tele-Kinetic abilities. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutiny only to be killed by their leader.Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill's group. The Guardians delay leaving Arete, choosing to rescue the children created by the High Evolutionary, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis.\nRocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat.Rocket spares the High Evolutionary, and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over, but is saved by Adam, who was saved from Arete by Groot as \"everyone deserves a second chance\".In the end, Quill decides to leave the Guardians, naming Rocket as captain, and travels to Earth to reunite with Jason (Gregg Henry), his grandfather. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora rejoins the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children.In a mid-credits scene, the new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued children), and Adam's pet Blurp, take on a new mission.",

        "synopsis": "Somewhere in the frozen wasteland, an expedition from Kord Industries, led by mercenary Ignacio Carapax, locates an alien Scarab, and delivers it into the hands of Victoria Kord, the company's CEO.In Palmera City, new college graduate Jaime Reyes returns home to his father Alberto, mother Rocio, sister Milagro, uncle Rudy, and Nana. After catching up, Jaime finds out that his family have fallen upon hard times while he was away. New developments by Kord Industries are slowly gentrifying his hometown, leading to his father losing his business, and the family are in dire threat of losing their home. On top of everything, Alberto has developed heart problems. Jaime is confident that he can get a good job with his college degree and support them, but despite his credentials, no one will hire him. Milagro gets him a job with her as a cleaner at Victoria Kord's mansion, meanwhile, Victoria finds that her niece, Jenny Kord, has come to confront her about a defunct superpolice technology called the One Man Army Corps (OMAC) that her father, former CEO Ted Kord, had ordered scrapped before his sudden disappearance. Victoria has revived the project and is developing it to sell to world powers, using a strange new tech. Jenny demands Victoria stop the OMAC project, as her father had turned Kord Industries away from weapons manufacturing, but Victoria refuses. Jaime sees her threatening Jenny, and steps in to defend her, leading to him and Milagro getting promptly fired. Jenny appreciates the gesture however, and tells Jaime to see her at Kord Tower so she can arrange another job for him and his sister. After a pep talk from his father, Jaime decides to take Jenny up on her offer.Jaime goes to Kord Tower, but is made to wait in the lobby. Elsewhere in the building, Jenny find's the source of OMAC's new technology; the Scarab. She steals it and runs, Jaime seeing her in the lobby and trying to catch up with her. As the alarm is sounded, Jenny panics and gives Jaime the Scarab, hidden in a burger box, and orders him to guard it, but never touch or even look at it. He confusedly agrees and takes it home. His family convince him to open the box and they examine the strange statuette. Upon being picked up, the Scarab suddenly comes to life and attaches itself to Jaime, painfully fusing to his back and encasing him in a set of alien armor. The Scarab speaks to him, and begins a check of its systems, launching him into space, sending him back to earth, and flying him helter skelter through the city causing damage before eventually returning him home. The family argue about what to do, Rudy insisting they not get the police involved, convinced that they work for Kord. Desperate to get the Scarab removed, Jaime decides to find Jenny and get some answers. He finds Jenny fleeing armed enforcers, and helps her get away. Jenny knew about the Scarab, as it had been in her father's possession long ago, but didn't know it would bond with Jaime, as it is sentient, and chooses it's own host. The only chance of getting it off him might be in her father's vault, but they will need a digital key stored at Kord Industries. Rudy takes them and sets off a homemade jamming device to block the cameras while Jaime and Jenny enter to steal the key, a smartwatch. Jenny explains that Victoria was Ted's older sister, but their father left the company to Ted. Victoria became bitter, and has been obsessed with progress and profit ever since. The jamming device gives out, and the group is attacked by Carapax in a prototype OMAC suit. The Scarab activates Jaime's suit, and he fights a losing battle with the bodyguard. The Scarab offers to take full control of Jaime's body, and demonstrates the suits capability of creating any weapon at will. However, Jaime stops the Scarab from killing Ignacio, which allows him to defeat the younger man and nearly kill him, but Rudy and Jenny ram Carapax with the jamming device and evacuate the injured Jaime. On the way, Jaime reveals the Scarab is named Khaji-Da, learning so after it took over his body and he temporarily merged with it's consciousness. They go to Jenny's dad's old mansion, and using the key, she takes them into a secret basement lair where Ted operated as the superhero Blue Beetle. He had the Scarab, which he deduced to be some kind of alien super-weapon, but it chose not to bond with him, so Ted created his own gadgets and suit from scratch. Rudy starts to hack Ted's computer while Jaime and Jenny head upstairs. The Scarab heals Jaime's wounds, and he and Jenny talk. Jenny's mother was the one that inspired her father to take up hero work and turn the company around, but after her death he became removed and obsessed. One day he disappeared, never to return. She admires Jaime's close family relationships, and they nearly kiss before Rudy tells them he has broken into the computer.Rudy finds out that the Scarab once fused with someone else, who was analyzed to create the prototype OMAC suit, but the project with shut down before it could be completed. Once the Scarab chooses a host, it merges with them on a cellular level, and does its best to protect the bearer. Unfortunately, the only way to remove the Scarab is to kill the host. Jaime is disheartened, and Rudy talks with him outside, encouraging him that maybe the Scarab is a gift instead of a curse. They see Victoria's helicopter headed towards the Reyes home, and Jaime races back. Victoria's army of enforcers storm the Reyes house and round up the family, demanding to know where their son is and setting fire to the house. Jaime arrives and the suit withstands their attacks, so they start targeting his family. Jaime defeats most of the soldiers, but Alberto and Milagro are pinned down by a soldier as Victoria and Carapax prepare a special weapon. Jaime and Khaji-Da take out the soldier, but Alberto begins suffering a heart attack, distracting Jaime long enough for Carapax to catch him in an electrified claw that incapacitates him. Carapax abducts Jaime as his father dies before the ambulance can arrive. In the morning, Rocio, Milagro, and Rudy are rallied by Nana to put their grief aside for the time being and save Jaime. Jenny offers to help, and takes them back to her childhood home. She brings them into Ted/Blue Beetle's Bugship, an armored airship, and head out to plan a rescue.Jaime is held prisoner inside an old island fortress near Cuba, where the OMAC is being developed. Victoria plans to download the Scarab's code into the OMAC neural systems, and duplicate it to create thousands of super-soldiers, unconcerned that the process will likely kill Jaime. Her lead scientist argues that they could learn more from the Scarab if they keep the host alive, but Victoria orders him to start extracting the Scarab's code into Carapax. Meanwhile, Jenny leads the Reyes family to the island, where Nana formulates a plan to storm the base using Kord's old tech. They land the ship amidst heavy fire, converting it into a walking tank-like vehicle, and blaze through the enforcers' ranks. Milagro heads into the labyrinthine tunnels with Jenny to find her brother. They duck into a side room to avoid the guards, and find that Victoria has already constructed thousands of OMAC units waiting for hosts, which are being powered up by the Scarab. In the lab, Jaime is put through excruciating pain from download, and his organs start to shut down. As he passes out, he sees a vision of Alberto, who encourages him to embrace his destiny and accept the Scarab instead of fighting against it. Jaime says goodbye to his dad, and reaches out to Khaji-Da while Jenny and Milagro place explosives on the generator. Jaime fully merges with the Scarab as the explosives go off, shutting down the extraction, but not before Carapax's OMAC suit is fully powered and operational. Jaime escapes his restraints, but the Scarab needs time to reboot. He is helped by the scientist, who is killed by Carapax in his newly transformed suit. Jaime runs, but is cornered by soldiers. Nana arrives and eliminates the enforcers, expertly operating a machine gun, and revealing she used to be a revolutionary in her youth. They make it back to the ship, but Milagro and Jenny have not returned, so Jaime goes back in to find them, along with Rudy. The explosion has separated the two girls, and Jenny is captured by Victoria and her guards. Milagro is pinned down, but Jaime finds her just in time. Now completely symbiotic with the Scarab, he easily takes down the soldiers and saves his sister, but is found and engaged by Carapax. A fierce fight ensues, Jaime eventually being beaten down by the bigger, stronger warrior. Rudy emerges and Carapax sends a rocket after him, seemingly killing him. Enraged, Jaime gains the upper hand, and prepares to take revenge for his father and uncle and kill Carapax, but is forcibly stopped by the Scarab. Now understanding compassion since merging with Jaime, it tells him what it saw upon being briefly downloaded into Ignacio's own mind, showing that he was conscripted as a child soldier as a young boy, how Victoria found him and took him to be her guinea pig for the OMAC project, and how his mother was killed by a random and senseless bomb attack, turning him into the cold hearted man he became. Jaime takes pity on him, and spares his life. Meanwhile, Victoria attempts to escape in a helicopter with Jenny in tow, showing her that even though if she loses the island facility, she has the Scarab's code in a portable device, and can start over. Jenny uses a protective foam gadget her dad left her to take out the pilots and throw herself and Victoria out of the helicopter to the ground safely. Jenny destroys the duplicated Scarab code, and Victoria orders Carapax to kill them. However, Carapax turns on her as the others escape, reuniting with a very much alive Rudy. Carapax overloads his suit, taking Victoria, the fortress, and all of the OMAC units with him as it explodes.The Reyes family grieve for Alberto, and the community rallies around them for support. Jenny takes over as CEO of Kord Industries, and promises to uphold her father's legacy. She gives Rudy a new truck, and tells them she will have her company rebuild the Rayes' home. Jenny says she is heading to her father's mansion, and Jaime offers to fly her there, and they share a kiss.Deep within the Blue Beetle's lair, a garbled transmission from Ted Kord desperately tells his daughter that he is still alive.",

While John is at the hospital, he notices a custodian (Isan Beomhyun Lee) attempting to steal a patient's belongings. The custodian later wakes up in a trap set up by John, his hand caught in a mechanical contraption and two vacuum tubes hooked up to his eyes. He has 60 seconds to turn a dial that will activate the contraption, breaking all five fingers on his right hand one by one, or else his eyes will be sucked out by the vacuum tubes. He only manages to break three of his fingers before the timer runs out and he gets his eyes vacuumed out, however, the trap sequence is revealed to have taken place entirely in John's imagination, and the custodian puts back the patient's belongings after noticing John watching him.At a support group meeting for cancer patients, John comes across Henry Kessler (Michael Beach), who claims to have terminal cancer and vows to keep fighting it until the end. Four months pass, and a bereft John is sitting in a coffee shop, about to sign his last will and testament, when he encounters a seemingly much healthier Henry, who claims to have been cured by an experimental cancer treatment given by Norwegian doctor Dr. Finn Pederson (Donagh Gordon). After doing some research, John finds the website of Pederson's daughter, Dr. Cecilia Pederson (Synn\u00f8ve Macody Lund), who is continuing her father's work and claims that corrupt pharmaceutical companies have been going after him, thus forcing her to perform further clinical trials of the treatment off the grid. John gets in touch with Cecilia, who refers him to her makeshift clinic in Mexico City for a surgery in two week's time.John travels to Mexico City and, upon arriving, is given a tour of the city by taxi driver Diego (Joshua Okamoto), who takes him to the facility, located in a remote location just outside the city boundaries. He is introduced to Gabriela (Renata Vaca), who claims to have been cured by Cecilia's treatment, as well as Cecilia and the rest of her medical team: nurse Valentina (Paulette Hernandez), anesthesiologist Mateo (Octavio Hinojosa) and surgeon Dr. Cortez. As Cecilia takes John to the operating room, located within an abandoned chemical factory, he encounters a young boy, Carlos (Jorge Brise\u00f1o), playing with a soccer ball outside the facility. Before his surgery, John speaks with Parker Sears (Steven Brand), who has just undergone a similar operation. Cecilia and her team conduct the surgery on John, and he awakens to find Cecilia congratulating him and assuring him that the surgery was successful. Believing himself to be cured of his cancer and finding a new lease on life, John fixes Carlos' bicycle before purchasing a bottle of tequila as a gift for Gabriela. Upon returning to the facility to present the gift, John finds the operating theatre abandoned and in a state of disarray. John realizes that the surgery never actually took place, his brain tumor was never removed and the experimental treatment was an elaborate scam.After figuring out that \"Dr. Cortez\" was Diego in disguise, John abducts the taxi driver. Diego wakes up back in the facility with John watching over him as his test begins. Diego has two pipe bombs wired into his arms and he must use two scalpels attached to his hands to cut through his flesh in order to remove the explosives. Diego survives his test and gives up information about the rest of the con artists. Meanwhile, while closing up his veterinarian's office, Mateo sells drugs to a desperate Gabriela, before he is abducted moments afterward by an assailant in a pig mask. The same assailant kidnaps Valentina while she is being assaulted by a stranger in his car, before going on to kidnap Gabriela from a nightclub bathroom and Cecilia from her home as she tries to escape in her car. The kidnapper removes their mask moments before Cecilia is abducted, revealing themselves to be Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), John's apprentice, with both her and John working together to kidnap Cecilia.Valentina, Cecilia, Mateo and Gabriela all wake up back in the disused factory they had used as the facility for their fraudulent activities, finding themselves in a deadly game overseen by John and Amanda. Valentina is the first to be tested, tasked with amputating her own leg with a Gigli saw and extracting an amount of bone marrow from her body. While she succeeds in cutting off her leg, she fails to extract the bone marrow in time and is subsequently decapitated by a wire. Cecilia's phone, located on a trolley, starts ringing, but is out of reach from everyone. Cecilia then disembowels Valentina's corpse and uses her intestines as a rope to pull the trolley close enough to reach her phone, making a call to someone and revealing she's been kidnapped but being interrupted when Amanda gives her an electric shock. Amanda, having struggled with drug addict herself in the past, expresses apprehensive over the prospect of Gabriela being tested. Mateo is the next to be tested, being tasked with cutting into his own skull and removing a piece of his own cerebral tissue and place it into a container of enzyme fluid in order to deactivate his trap. He removes a piece of brain matter successfully, however, it is not dissolved by the enzyme in time to release him, resulting in his death when a mask closes around his face and burns it.During the games, Parker returns to the compound, armed with a gun and demanding his money back after realizing the operation was a scam. As he navigates through the building, he is found by John and Amanda and is then chained up to a chair and made to watch the tests unfold. Gabriela is suspended in the air from shackles around her wrist and her ankle and put before an X-ray machine that will burn her flesh. To free herself, Gabriela must use a sledgehammer to break her wrist and ankle. She does so, and falls to the ground, heavily injured but still alive. John orders Amanda to take Gabriela to the hospital, but before she can, Parker holds the two of them at gunpoint and demands them to free Cecilia. As they unchain Cecilia, she shares a kiss with Parker before revealing that he was in on the scam from the beginning and that he was the one she had called on her phone, killing Gabriela by snapping her neck, which leaves Amanda distraught. Cecilia and Parker force John into one of his own traps at gunpoint, chaining him up in the same place Cecilia was in. Before she can do the same with Amanda, she hears Carlos playing with a soccer ball outside the facility again and takes him inside, chaining him up opposite John and wanting John to witness someone completely innocent meet their death in one of his traps, all while John pleads with them to stop what they're doing. The trap activates itself, revealing itself to be a seesaw-like contraption that begins to waterboard the two of them with blood. The two of them can pull levers to tilt the seesaw in their direction and thus bear the full brunt of the blasts, and John forces himself to endure non-stop blood-boarding in order to ensure Carlos' safety. Parker and Cecilia run to the room in which Amanda and John were controlling the games earlier in order to run away with the bags of money they'd acquired from the scam, however, upon taking the bag of money, it actives a tripwire that stops the blood-boarding trap. As Amanda frees Carlos and John, John watches from below as Parker and Cecilia find themselves trapped inside the control room in a test of their own, which is now filling up with a toxic gas. Their only respite is a hole in the wall that will only fit one of their heads, with Cecilia stabbing Parker to death in order to fit her head through the hole and escape the effects of the gas. The timer runs out and the gas stops coming out, but Cecilia is left trapped in the room as John, Carlos and Amanda exit the building, the movie ending as they walk out into the sunset together.In a mid-credits scene, John and another apprentice of his, Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), are overseeing Henry in a disused industrial bathroom (as seen in \"Saw\"), placing him in a trap intended to disembowel him.",
        "plot": "A sick and desperate John travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable."

        "synopsis": "Men believe that oceans are inhabited by mermaids, who come out during the full moon and lure men to their deaths with their siren voices. Eric is a prince of a sea faring people guided by his advisor Sir Grimsby (Art Malik) and adoptive mother Queen Selina (Noma Dumezweni).Ariel (Halle Bailey) is a mermaid princess and the youngest daughter of King Triton (Javier Bardem), ruler of the Mer-people of Atlantica. She is fascinated with the human world despite never having seen it, as Triton forbids all Merfolk from surfacing there after Ariel's mother was killed by a human.\nAriel keeps a collection of human artifacts that fall into the ocean from their ships. She also studies the human shipwrecks to satisfy her curiosity about their ways. Flounder and Scuttle and Ariel's best friends.\nAriel's sisters are Perla (Lorena Andrea), Indira (Simone Ashley), Mala (Karolina Conchet), Tamika (Sienna King), Karina (Kajsa Mohammar), and Caspia (Nathalie Sorrell).\nTriton assigns his advisor Sebastian to look over Ariel and to keep her safe. Meanwhile, Triton's banished sister Ursula watches the events from afar waiting and biding her time.One night, Ariel sees fireworks above the ocean and surfaces to see them better. They come from the ship of Eric (Jonah Hauer-King), the prince of a nearby island. Ariel overhears that Eric also longs to discover the new world and does not want to be shackled as the King of his Island.\nWhen a storm arrives, the ship crashes against rocks, forcing all to go for the lifeboats. Eric waits till everybody has left the ship, but by that time the ship lists dangerously in the water and Eric loses his balance to fall into the ocean.\nAriel saves Eric, brings him to shore, and sings with her siren voice to help save his life. She flees before he is rescued by the fellow survivors from the shipwreck.Ursula watches the events unfold over her magic orb, and vows to take back the powerful Trident back from Triton. She knows that soon Ariel will be alienated by Triton and driven into her tentacles.\nSebastian tries to tell Ariel about the treasures of the sea that she has not explored yet and tries to subconsciously nudge her not to explore the human world anymore. But Sebastian could not guess that Ariel was already in love with Eric.\nMeanwhile, Eric is obsessed with finding the woman who saved his life. Selina is concerned about the rising number of shipwrecks around the Island and bans Eric from undertaking any more voyages.Noticing Ariel's absent-minded behavior, Triton questions his advisor Sebastian the crab (Daveed Diggs), who reveals that she saved a human. Enraged, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto to confront her; when she refuses to swear to never return to the surface, he destroys her collection of human objects. Ariel is later approached by two moray eels sent by the sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), Triton's estranged sister and Ariel's aunt, who was banished from Atlantica 15 years prior.\nThe eels lure Ariel to Ursula's lair deep beneath the oceans. Ursula says that she understands love in a way that Triton never will.At Ursula's lair, Ariel is presented with a deal: she will turn into a human for three days, during which she must receive \"true love's kiss\" to remain human permanently. If Ariel fails, she will transform back into a mermaid and Ursula will claim her. To become human, Ariel must give up her tail, the ability to breathe underwater, and her siren voice, the last of which Ursula will keep in a nautilus shell. Ariel accepts the deal.\nAfter receiving human legs, she is taken to the surface by Sergeant Major Flounder (Jacob Tremblay), her best friend, and Sebastian. In the human world, she is rescued by fishermen and taken to Eric's castle. The maids of the castle take Ariel in and give her clothes and a bath to make her look presentable.\nEric, who has been searching for the woman who saved his life, rushes to meet Ariel. However, her lack of voice has him immediately turning away, though he does allow Ariel to stay in the castle for as long as she wants.\nSebastian, who has followed Ariel, realizes that Ursula has put a cheat in the spell that is causing Ariel to forget that she needs to kiss Eric.While exploring the castle, Ariel finds Eric's collection of items he accumulated over his travels. Eric spends time with her poring over his collection that has come from his voyages. Ariel fascinates Eric with her knowledge about the seas and its artifacts. Eric teaches Ariel about the human world in return.The next day, Eric takes Ariel sightseeing around the kingdom.\nAlong with Scuttle (Awkwafina), a northern gannet, and Flounder, Sebastian takes it upon himself to get the pair to kiss. Scuttle steals Eric's hat and flies towards the ocean, forcing Eric and Ariel to pursue it on a boat. Then Sebastian orchestrates the jungles and the oceans to produce a romantic and enticing tune to set the mood.\nThey are almost successful but are thwarted by Ursula's eels who tip the boat over. Enraged by the close call, Ursula turns into a human and uses Ariel's siren voice to hypnotize Eric.\nBack at Atlantica, Triton has the kingdom search for Ariel and begins to regret the way he treated her.The next morning, Ariel and her friends discover that Eric will be announcing his engagement to \"Vanessa\" (Ursula's alter ego) later that day. Scuttle hears Ariel's voice and follows it to Vanessa's room where he sees in the mirror that Vanessa is really Ursula and flies to warn Ariel.\nAriel rushes to the engagement party, confronts Ursula, and breaks the shell. She gains back her voice, and the enchantment on Eric is broken. However, before they can kiss, the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Reverting to her original form, Ursula drags Ariel back into the ocean.Wanting to save Ariel, Triton confronts Ursula. However, the deal that she made with Ariel is unbreakable. Triton trades himself for Ariel and is turned to dust by the eels, much to her horror. Ursula claims Triton's trident just before Ariel confronts her while Eric arrives.\nUrsula attempts to destroy Eric, but to save Eric the second time, Ariel intervenes and intentionally attacks Ursula, who unintentionally kills her eels. Enraged, she uses the trident to grow in size and summons a storm to threaten Ariel and Eric. Ariel gets on a surfaced ship.Ursula is about to kill Eric with the trident. Saving Eric the third time, Ariel kills Ursula and impales her with its splintered bowsprit. Once Ursula dies, Triton comes back to life. Ariel picks up Triton's trident and hands it back to Triton. Triton is proud of Ariel for saving Eric three times and killing Ursula. Triton and Ariel recognize the other's sacrifice for them.Ariel returns home, where she is unhappy without Eric. On Sebastian's advice, Triton transforms Ariel into a human permanently, and she marries Eric.

        "synopsis": "Izi (Kane Robinson), walks into a common washroom to take a bath, This is particularly problematic because Izi lives in The Kitchen, which is one of the last remaining community social housing units in London. The dystopian future has seen class differences grow to tremendous measures, and together with economic disparity, it has led to very segregated areas in the city. The London of the rich and privileged still exists, where people in fashionable clothes go around shopping in luxurious stores. The poor are limited to the fringes and some corners of the city, where the socially and financially weak live in ghetto-like communities.The authorities have banned the concept of social housing, for every building and construction is considered private property. Therefore, any settlers who stay together in groups at these buildings are considered illegal intruders, and they are often harassed and beaten up by police, resulting in arrests. Izi lives in one of the last remaining social housings, known as The Kitchen.Izi spends his own sweet time in the bathroom, taking away from both the time and water capacity that have been allotted for the entire building. The long line of people who loudly protest against the man's habit, with some even banging on the door of the bathroom, does not deter him. This world also now has interactive mirrors, which act like screens and bring up messages and notifications about upcoming events.Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman) and Izi meet at Izi's workplace, which is a big showroom for a corporation named Life After Life. The company is basically a burial service of the future, which promises to turn a subject's body into manure after their death, with a tree planted and cared for for many years after the death. The service seems to be quite popular among citizens, mainly because of the idea that one's beloved family members get to live for many years after their death, in the form of a tree.\nAlthough Life After Life claims that all trees are kept for a very long time, there is perhaps a suggestion in the film that the company only keeps and displays the trees until the dead subjects are visited or relevant, other than that they are discarded.Izi, has been working hard at this showroom, using all his skills to convince people to buy the burial service from Life After Life. Jase (Demmy Ladipo) is Izi's friend at work.\nOn this particular day, the man suddenly spots the funeral service of a woman named Toni Clarke going on and is visibly startled by it. Izi goes down to the lower depths of the office and witnesses the funeral, which is only attended by the woman's teenage son, Benji. The boy is also more shocked at the loss of his mother than he is grievous at the moment, and he is unable to say anything in memory of his mother.Once the funeral is over and Toni's body has been converted into a small plant, Izi watches Benji from a distance, never going in front of the boy. But Benji had already spotted the man and had realized that his mother must have meant something to him, because of which Izi had been witnessing the whole affair. As Izi steps out of the office at the end of his shift, Benji approaches him and directly asks how he had known Toni. Benji does not know who his father is, and he had hoped that the man might show up during the woman's funeral. Since Izi had been there, the boy suspected that he might be his father, even though Izi immediately rejected the idea, stating that he had only been a friend of Toni a long time ago.Although Benji does not get the blood relative he was looking for in Izi, the man does agree to give him a ride on his motorcycle, and the boy learns that Izi is a resident of the Kitchen. The end of the day is tremendously boring and sad for Benji, since he is all alone in his apartment and in the world after the death of his mother. It is all the more saddening because it is Benji's birthday at midnight as well, and the boy unwraps the last gift that his mother had left him-a bicycle. With this bicycle, Benji goes over to the Kitchen the next morning, looking for Izi, or any friend at the place, for that matter.Along with benevolent residents, the Kitchen also has a few rough groups who get involved in illegal and shady activities to ensure that the community gets its food and resources. Staples (Hope Ikpoku Jr) is a young man who leads such a group, and together with his team, he regularly loots food and supply trucks from the city, bringing them back to the Kitchen. As Staples sees Benji riding his bike quite skillfully, the man befriends the boy and gets quite close to him over time. The first night Benji reached the Kitchen, he couldn't find Izi and it was Staples who provide him with a place to stay and sleep. Staples gang includes Oozie (Alan Asaad), Kamale (BackRoad Gee) and others.As Izi and Benji meet each other a couple more times, it becomes very evident that Benji wants to stay at the Kitchen with the man. The boy even manages to convince Izi to let him stay in his allotted flat in the community housing building for two days. Izi agrees as he doesn't want Benji to stay with Staples and his gang.\nDuring this time, he also witnesses the scary and uncertain part of life at the Kitchen, for the place is often raided by the police, who come to beat up and arrest the people living there illegally. The news of the police coming into the buildings is spread by people frantically beating on utensils and making a warning noise, and total chaos follows this during every raid.Izi is always concerned only with his own demands and needs. Therefore, the man has also been on his plan of climbing up the social ladder and leaving the Kitchen. As he has managed to save up some money as advance rent on a luxurious single-occupancy apartment, Izi plans on moving into the place very soon. When Benji appears and wants to stay in his life, Izi is rather disturbed by the proposition, and he technically abandons the boy in Kitchen to move into his new single-occupancy apartment.Izi had once considered taking the boy along and had tried to look for a double-occupancy apartment, but because of the long waiting list for such housing spaces, he had to give up on the apartment that was already being offered to him. Izi refuses to give it up and instead moves into this mechanical and lifeless apartment, which has fake scenery in place of windows, and decides to forget about the boy. However, on this very day, a massive police raid takes place at the Kitchen, which even leads to the death of Lord Kitchener (Ian Wright), the man who would provide motivation to the entire community through the radio broadcast. When Izi sees the funeral of Lord Kitchener taking place at Life After Life, he is shocked to learn what has happened and reconsiders his decision to abandon Benji.When Izi leaves the scene, Benji also finds company in Staples and his gang.After the death of Lord Kitchener, Staples and his gang call for retaliation on the civil society that hates them so much, and a revenge plan is made. The group rides out to the shopping complexes and private apartments in the city and wreaks havoc there, looting, plundering, and inflicting violence on everyone. Benji is also made a part of this rioting, but the boy gets tremendously scared when all this is taking place. As a result, Benji runs away from the gang and the place, making his way back to The Kitchen.Izi returns to the community and reunites with Benji, apologizing for having left him behind. As a compensation for his selfish act, Izi also brings the plant with Toni's remains from his workplace, giving it to Benji so that the boy can plant it at a spot of his choice. The Kitchen also gets raided by the police soon, and the two somehow manage to protect themselves from getting caught or beaten up. Staples and his team also manage to trap the police and lash out at them as an act of retaliation.As Izi and Benji look out from the safe space of their Kitchen flat, the boy once again asks the man whether he is his father. Izi responds that he would be if Benji would like him to be.\nBefore her death, Toni had told her son that his father was someone who worked at Life After Life and also lived at the Kitchen, and the reaction of Izi to the woman's death and then to Benji definitely suggests that he is indeed the father.",
        "plot": "In a dystopian future London where all social housing has been eliminated, Izi and Benji fight to navigate the world as residents of The Kitchen, a community that refuses to abandon their home."

        "synopsis": "Misanthrope Amanda Sandford (Julia Roberts) arranges an impromptu weekend getaway at a vacation rental to spend quality time together with her husband Clay (Ethan Hawke) and their kids, Archie (Charlie Evans) and Rose (Farrah Mackenzie). The vacation rental home is by the beach and Amanda is looking forward to get away from her New York life.\nWhile shopping for groceries, Amanda sees a man stocking up on large quantities of canned food and water.\nLater, while the family relaxes at a nearby beach, they evade an oil tanker that runs ashore. The authorities say that there has been a problem with a navigational system and there have been reports of many such groundings across the coast.\nWhen they return to the house, they notice the TV and Wi-Fi are not working and a pair of deer stare at them.That night, the owner, George H. (\"G.H.\") Scott (Mahershala Ali), and his daughter, Ruth (Myha'La), arrive at the house. Seeking shelter, G.H. explains that a blackout caused their return. Ruth explains that they have an apartment on the 14th floor in the city and GH could not climb 14 floors due to a knee injury. GH and Ruth are African Americans and Amanda is skeptical about their story. Ruth reminds Amanda that this is their house.\nAmanda is suspicious and doesn't want them to stay. Clay however trusts them and lets them stay the night. GH pays back $1000 to Amanda, which is half of what she paid GH for the entire weekend, as a peace offering.\nIn private, Amanda tells Clay that the story doesn't fit as they didn't hear the car come up the driveway and they haven't seen any IDs, so GH and Ruth are effectively strangers.\nAmanda wants to see GH's ID, but he claims that he left it in his coat pocket at the Symphony Opera which he visited earlier that day. There are no pictures in the home to prove that GH and Ruth live there. GH claims that his wife is on a business trip to Morocco, and she is scheduled to land the next morning.The next morning, Rose is frustrated that the Wi-Fi and TV are still down, which has prevented her from watching the series finale of Friends. Amanda notices four news alerts on her phone about the blackout, the third of which is about hackers, and the final one shows a corrupted message. Rose sees a larger herd of deer motionless in the backyard.\nRuth is getting paranoid, while GH continues to say that it is probably nothing and things will go back to normal soon. Ruth learns that Clay is a Professor of Media Studies, while Amanda is a client relations manager in Advertising.\nGH secretly removes his gun from the liquor cabinet.Attempting to learn about the disruptions and fix the Wi-Fi, Clay drives to town while G.H. heads to his neighbor's house who live a few miles down the road.\nClay's radio picks up intermittent reports of an ongoing Cyberattack on the country leading to an environmental disaster in the South, which is impacting animal migration patterns.\nClay abandons a Spanish-speaking woman seeking help and drives from a drone dropping leaflets written in Arabic, while G.H. searches the neighbor's home and finds a Satellite phone which also does not connect to any network.\nGH discovers the wreckage of a plane crash on the nearby beach, and narrowly avoids a second one.Elsewhere, Rose walks along with Archie in the nearby woods, where they come across an empty shed, and Archie removes a tick from his ankle on the way back.\nReturning to the house, G.H. confides to Amanda the events he witnessed. He theorizes that nationwide satellite connectivity has been disrupted, but he is cut off by a loud, shrill noise.\nAmanda runs out into the woods to bring Rose and Archie back to safety.Amanda recalls the man stockpiling supplies, whom G.H. assumes is Danny (Kevin Bacon), his contractor. Clay returns shaken with the leaflet, which Archie partially translates as \"Death to America\".\nFed up, the Sandfords flee the rental, intending to drive to Amanda's sister in New Jersey, but find the highway jammed with collided self-driving Teslas; they narrowly avoid more incoming cars, and they are forced to return to G.H.'s house.That night Rose still tries to watch the season finale of Friends, while Archie masturbates to pictures of Ruth he had taken when they were by the pool.\nThroughout the night, Ruth asks Clay provocative questions (like if he ever had sex with one of his students), and they later discover flamingos in the pool.\nAmanda and G.H. establish a friendly bond but they are cut off by a second shrill noise, and the power fails. GH had told Amanda about a friend of his who is into defense contracting and hangs out with some of the most evil men on the planet, who called him the previous evening and asked GH to move all of his money around, which involved big numbers. The friend told GH to \"Take care of himself\".\nLater, Rose tells Amanda a story from an episode of The West Wing where God attempts to save a man from a flood with several warnings and escape opportunities.Ruth tells GH that he needs to stop trusting Amanda and Clay so much, and start looking out for himself and her, as the world continues to fall apart around them.The next morning, Archie's teeth inexplicably fall out. Believing it is related to the tick bite, G.H. suggests visiting Danny for medicine (he speculates that it could be Lime disease).\nRose is now missing, and G.H. and Clay take Archie to visit Danny, while Amanda and Ruth search for Rose. At the shed in the woods behind the house, the two are confronted by an even larger herd of deer, which they scare away.\nMeanwhile, G.H. and Clay attempt to convince Danny to help Archie, which results in an armed standoff between G.H. and Danny. Clay intervenes, convincing Danny to help Archie. Clay offers Danny $1000 for some antibiotics for Archie.\nAfterward, Danny tells G.H. that another neighbor may be equipped with an underground bunker and suggests that the noise and Archie's teeth falling out are the results of a microwave weapon. Danny says that the same kind of weapon was tested in Cuba.Shaken, G.H. hypothesizes to Clay and Archie that the country is in a three-stage campaign that will result in a Coup D'Etat. The first stage is to isolate the target by disabling their communications and transportation. Second stage is synchronized chaos via disinformation, which turns people against each other. Third stage is civil war and total collapse of society. GH says that he studied military programs, and this was considered to be the most cost effective way to destabilize a country, if it was dysfunctional enough.At the same time, Amanda and Ruth watch New York City being bombed.\nRose then finds the neighbor's house with the bunker. Inside, a computer message warns of elevated radiation levels across multiple U.S. cities. She finds a DVD of Friends and watches the series finale.",

        "synopsis": "During her days of entrapment in the Quantum Realm, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) (Pym's wife, Hope's mother, and the original Wasp, who was lost in the Quantum Realm for 30 years) encounters an exiled traveler named Kang (Jonathan Majors). Kang is a \"time-traveling, Multiversal adversary\" trapped in the Quantum Realm who needs Pym Particles to get his ship and a device online that would allow him to go anywhere and when in time.In the present day, after the Avengers' battle against Thanos. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) (An Avenger and former petty criminal with a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while increasing in strength) has become a successful Memoirist and has been living happily with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) (The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne who is handed down a similar suit and the Wasp mantle from her mother). Hope has taken back her father's company and is using the Pym Particle for the betterment of humanity. Scott's now-teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has become a political activist in helping people displaced by the Blip, resulting in her having a strained relationship with her father.While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) (A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man after creating the suit) and Janet, Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. Upon learning of this, Janet panics and forcefully shuts off the device, but the message is received, resulting in a portal that opens and sucks the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Hank and Cassie's ants, who by now are highly evolved are also sucked in. Scott and Cassie (who are separated from the others) are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Pym explore a sprawling city to get answers.Hope, Janet, and Pym meet with Lord Krylar (Bill Murray) (The governor of the lavish Axia community in the Quantum Realm), a former ally of Janet's, who reveals that things have changed since she left, and that he is now working for Kang, the Quantum Realm's new ruler. The three are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. The Langs, meanwhile, are told by rebel leader Jentorra (Katy O'Brian) (The leader of the Freedom Fighters rebelling against Kang's oppression of the communities in the Quantum Realm) that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power.The rebels soon come under attack by Kang's forces led by M.O.D.O.K. (Mechanized Organism designed only for killing), who is revealed to be Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) (Pym's former protege who was shrunken to subatomic size in the Quantum Realm during the events of Ant-Man (2015) and became a mutated, Cybernetically enhanced individual with an oversized head known as M.O.D.O.K.), having survived his apparent death at the hands of Scott.Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Pym why she wanted nothing to do with the Quantum Realm again; Kang claimed that he and Janet could both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his Multiversal power core. After they managed to repair it, Janet saw a vision of Kang conquering and destroying entire time-lines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his variants out of fear, which drove Janet to turn against him. Outmatched, Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core beyond use. Kang, having regained his powers, eventually conquered the Quantum Realm afterward.The Langs are taken to Kang, who demands that Scott helps get his power core back or else he will kill Cassie. Scott is then taken to the core's location and shrinks down. He is nearly drowned in a sea of variants of himself (as Scott approaches the core, he is in the storm of probability where every possible version of himself exists simultaneously), but Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang reneges on the deal, capturing Janet and destroying her ship with Hank on it. After being rescued by his ants, who were also pulled into the Quantum Realm, rapidly evolved, and became hyper-intelligent, Pym helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to Kang.Kang reveals his plan to use the power core to transport his entire army to the multi-verse to eliminate his other variants and to take complete control of the time-lines. But the uprising brings the entire Quantum realm to fight against Kang and his forces are near defeat. Kang is forced to enter the battle himself, allowing Janet to escape captivity and pursue the power core. Kang forces the rebels to run for cover and the revolution is almost defeated. This is when Hank's ants enter the battle and turn the tide in the rebels favor. During the fight, Cassie convinces Cross to switch sides and fight Kang, though he sacrifices his life. The ants are technologically superior to Kang and are able to easily overrun him.Janet fixes the power core as she, Pym, Hope, and Cassie jump through a portal home, but Kang attacks Scott. Before he can beat Scott into submission, Hope returns, and she and Scott throw Kang and Pym Particles into the power core, destroying them both. Cassie reopens the portal for Scott and Hope to return home. As Scott happily resumes his life, he begins to rethink what he was told about Kang's death being the start of something terrible happening but brushes it off.In a mid-credits scene: numerous variants of Kang, led by Immortus, commiserate Kang's death and plan their Multiversal uprising.In a post-credits scene: Loki and Mobius M. Mobius encounter another Kang variant, Victor Timely, on Earth in 1901.",
        "plot": "Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne are dragged into the Quantum Realm, along with Hope's parents and Scott's daughter Cassie. Together they must find a way to escape, but what secrets is Hope's mother hiding? And who is the mysterious Kang?"

One day earlier, upset at learning she is pregnant, guitar technician Beth visits her sister Ellie, a tattoo artist and single mother to teenagers Danny and Bridget, and child Kassie, in their home at Monde Apartments, a condemned Los Angeles apartment complex. The building is shaken by an earthquake while the children are in its basement parking lot, uncovering a concealed chamber. Danny investigates it, discovering religious artifacts, three phonograph records from 1923, and a strange book that he takes up to his room, believing he could possibly sell it and use the money to help Ellie. The initial record details rejected efforts by a priest to research the book, revealed to be one of three volumes of the Naturom Demonto. The subsequent record reveals the priest continued his research in secret and recites an incantation that summons demonic entities known as Deadites. The building's power fails, and an isolated Ellie is attacked and possessed by an unseen force. She returns to the apartment in a trance, menacingly threatens her family, and dies after pleading with Beth to protect her children. Beth and Ellie's neighbors help lay her to rest in her bedroom and search for a way out. They find that the staircase has collapsed, the elevator is damaged, and they are unable to access the fire escape before Ellie revives and attacks the family, wounding Bridget. Beth and the children lock Ellie outside the apartment after she pursues and massacres the neighbors. Danny confesses to Beth about recovering the Naturom Demonto, and Ellie tricks Kassie into unlocking the door before attacking her. While Danny and Beth are distracted rescuing Kassie and locking Ellie out, Bridget becomes possessed via her wound. Bridget attacks Beth before turning on Danny and Kassie, who inadvertently impales her through the head with a broken broom handle. Beth listens to the third record to understand how to exorcise the Deadites, but learns the priest failed and his allies were all possessed, with only complete destruction of the host stopping the Deadites. Bridget revives and fatally stabs Danny, who sets Bridget on fire before dying as Ellie infiltrates the apartment using the vents. Realizing Beth is pregnant, Ellie attempts to rip the fetus out of her, but Beth and Kassie are able to incapacitate her with scissors. Ellie fails to emotionally manipulate Kassie who accepts that her mother is already gone. Danny and the bodies of the neighbors are possessed, leading Beth and Kassie to take shelter in the damaged elevator. Ellie, Bridget, and Danny merge into a multi-limbed creature known as the Marauder and climb atop the elevator to attack the pair as the machine fills with blood. The combined weight causes the elevator to plummet to the ground floor, allowing Beth and Kassie to flee into the parking lot. The Marauder captures Kassie and attempts to behead her with a chainsaw, but Beth returns and distracts it, and she and Kassie destroy the Marauder's body by forcing it into a wood chipper. Ellie's decapitated head taunts Beth, saying she will be a failure as a mother, prompting her to kick Ellie's head into the chipper. Beth and Kassie escape the building together. The next morning, Jessica goes to the parking lot to leave for her vacation, where she is attacked by an unseen force.",

        "synopsis": "Prior to imprisonment, bard Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine) served in the Harpers, an order of peacekeepers (sworn to defend the oppressed and fight tyranny), until his wife Zia (Georgia Landers) was killed by disciples of a Red Wizard he had arrested.\nWith Zia's death, Edgin abandoned his oath. Edgin took to drinking heavily and that's when he met Holga. Holga was a resident of Rock Bottom and was cast aside by her tribe for falling in love with an outsider. Holga took pity on Edgin and took him and Kira in. She saw Edgin like a brother.\nHolga and Edgin turned to theft to fund their survival. Kira grew up in this atmosphere.Accompanied by barbarian Holga Kilgore (Michelle Rodriguez), Edgin attempted to make a new life for himself and his daughter Kira (Chloe Coleman) by turning to theft, teaming with amateur sorcerer Simon Aumar (Justice Smith) (a half-elf wild magic sorcerer who is the descendant of Elminster Aumar, a notable wizard), rogue con artist Forge Fitzwilliam (Hugh Grant), and Forge's mysterious acquaintance Sofina (Daisy Head).\nWhile raiding a Harper stronghold, Edgin attempted to steal a \"Tablet of Reawakening\" to resurrect his wife, but he and Holga were captured while their accomplices escaped. Simon was unable to stop Sofina's magic, which was too powerful for him.\nEdgin entrusted the Tablet to Forge and asked him to keep Kira safe.After two years' imprisonment in arctic Revel's End, the pair, unaware they have been pardoned, escape to Neverwinter and learn Forge has become Lord there after its prior lord fell mysteriously incapacitated. Forge has been taking care of Kira, convincing her that Edgin's selfish greed led to his arrest. It is revealed that Sofina is a Red Wizard and together they orchestrated Edgin and Holga's capture.\nForge had told Kira that Edgin was after the Tablet of Riches, but Edgin clarifies that it was the Tablet of Reawakening. Forge refuses to hand over the Tablet to Edgin. Kira does not believe Edgin.Sofina attempts to execute Edgin and Holga, but they escape and decide to rob Forge's vault and bring Kira home during the upcoming High Sun Games, needing the tablet to prove their innocence to Kira and resurrect Edgin's wife.\nForge tells Kira that he gave the Tablet of Riches to Edgin and he left.The gladiatorial games had been banned, but Forge re-instituted them, promising that the games would bring tourists and money. Edgin and Holga track down Simon to help; he suggests also recruiting Doric (Sophia Lillis) (a Tiefling druid raised in the Neverwinter Wood by a wood elf enclave), a druid whose forest community is fighting forced logging ordered by Forge.\nDoric agrees to help Edgin as there is no one else willing to stand up to Forge.Shapeshifted into a fly, Doric infiltrates Forge's castle, finding the vault has magical defenses from Mordenkainen, which Simon cannot disable. Simon believes a magic relic, \"The Helm of Disjunction,\" could disable them. It's a helmet that disables all nearby enchantments. The Helm went missing ages ago.\nThey travel to an old graveyard to ask Holga's ancestors where to find it. Simon resurrects the dead with a talisman long enough for them to answer five questions each.\nThe corpses reveal they gave the Helm to Xenk Yandar (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page) (a paladin who narrowly escaped Szass Tam's \"rise to power\" in Thay and as a result, \"ages more slowly than a normal human\"), a paladin who fled his country, Thay, when Szass Tam (Ian Hanmore) (a powerful Red Wizard and the ruler of Thay) turned Thayans into an Undead army. Not being asked enough questions, one corpse is left \"alive\".Xenk agrees to help the group when he realizes that Forge has made an alliance with the Red Wizard. He suspects that Tam is up to something. Currently, Tam's powers do not extend beyond Thay and that is what he wants to change.\nAfter forcing Edgin to swear to distribute any gained bounty to the people, Xenk guides the group through the Underdark to retrieve the Helm. With the help of a teleportation staff obtained from Holga's half-ling ex-husband, they find the relic but are attacked by Thayan assassins sent by Sofina. Xenk fights off the assassins and helps the group escape from the obese red dragon Themberchaud before departing.Simon has trouble mastering the Helm's power as the Helm refuses to allow Simon to wield its power. Simon blames Edgin as he says that he told Edgin that this plan is not going to work. The group loses their morale, and everyone wants to quit. Edgin narrates that he stole Red Wizard's treasure and didn't know that they marked it. He led the Red Wizards right to his own doorstep and his family paid the price for it. Edgin says that he cannot quit.\nThey decide to use the staff to enter the vault during the games. But the portal opens into a stone wall and Doric tries to dig a hole into the wall to get through as a worm. Edgin decides to enter the vault through the front door and attacks the castle with Holga and Simon. Simon gets to the door of the vault and successfully attunes with the helmet to open the magically sealed door.Simon and Holga infiltrate the magically sealed door but find the room empty except for a magical trap. Doric infiltrates the location where the treasure is stored, and it is under the arena.\nSofina, disguised as Kira, subdues Edgin.\nThe group is captured and forced to participate in the games but manages to escape the stadium. Doric discovers Forge has loaded the treasure onto a boat and is preparing to flee. The group cannot figure out what Sofina gets out of the deal, if Forge is escaping with all the loot.\nThe group steals the boat for themselves and rescues Kira from Forge, who threatened Kira's life.As they escape, the group realize Sofina organized the games to draw a massive crowd and turn them into an Undead army using the same curse that destroyed Thay. The group returns, transporting Forge's stolen riches out of the boat with the teleportation staff and spreading them across the city by hot-air balloon, drawing people out of the stadium before Sofina's spell takes effect.Enraged at her defeat, Sofina attacks the group, but Simon manages to master his magic and nullify Sofina's time-stop spell, allowing Kira to use an invisibility pendant Edgin and Holga gave her as a child to place an anti-magic bracelet on Sofina. Sofina is killed when attacked by Doric in owl-bear form and then crushed by falling debris, but Holga is fatally injured. Edgin uses the tablet to bring her back to life, accepting that he wanted to bring back his wife only for his own sake while Holga had become a true part of their family. Doric signals openness to a relationship with Simon.Restored, the old Lord of Neverwinter declares the team heroes of the realm. Xenk sends Forge to Revel's End, where he spectacularly fails to escape as Edgin and Holga did when his pardon was denied.",

        "synopsis": "In 2002 Los Angeles, a young Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed sneaks out with his best friend, Golden Gloves champion Damian \"Diamond Dame\" Anderson, to watch Dame compete in an underground boxing match. After Dame's victory, Dame tells Donnie about his aspirations to turn professional and become a world champion. During a detour at a liquor store, Donnie impulsively attacks a man named Leon.Fifteen later, in 2018 Donnie fights and wins in a rematch against \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan, who just got released from his prison sentence and worked his way back to be a contender for championship fight. He retires from boxing to focus on his wife Bianca and their daughter Amara. Three years later, Donnie runs Delphi Boxing Academy with his coach Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers Jr., and is promoting his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, world champion Felix \"El Guerrero\" Chavez, in a match against Viktor Drago. Due to her hearing problems, Bianca forgoes performing and becomes a successful producer. The two keep watch over the declining health of Donnie's adoptive mother Mary Anne. Amara aspires to be a boxer like her father, which gets her into trouble in school.Dame is released from prison and reconnects with Donnie, to whom he shares his desires to continue his boxing career. Donnie reluctantly invites Dame to the gym to spar with Chavez, however his aggressive style draws scorn from Chavez and Duke. Dame later visits Donnie's home, where he meets his family and shares about their time together at a group home, which Bianca has never heard of. Privately, Dame expresses his desire for a title shot against Chavez, citing Donnie's previous one-in-a-million shot, which Donnie refuses.At a party for Bianca's record label, Dame cryptically tells Bianca about Leon before Drago is attacked by an unknown assailant; his injury casts doubt on his fight with Chavez. Donnie suggests Dame as an opponent, pitching an underdog fight much like how his father gave Rocky a first title shot, which Chavez gladly accepts. During the fight, Dame fights dirty, but knocks out Chavez, winning the undisputed heavyweight championship.After the match, an uneasy Donnie visits Mary Anne, who shows him letters Dame wrote to Donnie while in prison that she kept from him due to believing he was a bad influence. One letter contains a picture showing Dame with a fellow inmate that Donnie recognizes as the one who assaulted Drago. Realizing Dame orchestrated the attack, Donnie confronts him. Dame reveals that he manipulated all their encounters to set him up as a champion to enact revenge for Donnie abandoning him during his arrest and jail time, before giving him a black eye. Donnie is unable to open up to Bianca about his guilt over Dame, who revels in his newfound fame and publicly slanders Donnie as a fraud who turned his back on him.Mary Anne suffers another stroke and dies. After the funeral, Donnie confesses to Bianca the truth: Leon was the abusive caregiver in the group home Dame and Donnie lived in before Donnie was adopted. After Donnie attacked Leon at the liquor store, a brawl against Leon's friends ensued causing Dame to pull a gun. As cops arrived, Donnie fled, but Dame was arrested. Attempting to block out the memory, Donnie never contacted Dame out of shame and guilt. Knowing Dame would not stop defaming him, he tells Bianca there's only one way to bring him down.Donnie goes on First Take, where Dame calls in to goad Donnie over the phone. Donnie decides to come out of retirement and challenges Dame for the championship, which he accepts. After training with Duke and a recovered Drago, Donnie faces Dame in the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" at Dodger Stadium. Donnie faces Dame in a grueling, evenly matched affair. In the final round, Donnie uses Duke's advice to let go of his fear and guilt and takes advantage of Dame's drained energy, delivering a knockout to win the match and the championship. Afterwards, Donnie reconciles with Dame, with both men admitting it was not the other's fault. Donnie joins Bianca and Amara in the ring in the empty stadium, where he pretends to box with Amara.",

He is often bullied at school and has no friends or any social life. One day, Peter elects to stay inside during recess, and earns some sympathy from his substitute teacher Miss Devine. Despite having plans to go trick-or-treating on Halloween Night, his parents forbid him due to the disappearance of a young girl several years ago.Later that night, Peter is awoken by a tapping sound coming from inside the bedroom walls. Both his parents strongly deny these occurrences, insisting that he is imagining them. Over the next few days, Peter continues to talk with the mysterious entity, who he learns is named \"Sarah\". Sarah claims that she was trapped in the walls by Peter's parents, calling them \"evil\"; leaving Peter disturbed.Devine becomes concerned after seeing a picture that Peter drew of Sarah asking for help in a dark room. Following a meeting with Peter's parents, they wave her off and, later on, Carol confronts and admonishes him for bringing his delusions into public scrutiny. Sarah continues to convince Peter that his parents are bad people.At school, Brian, a bully, destroys Peter's prize pumpkin. Spurred on by Sarah's advice, Peter pushes Brian down the stairs, breaking his leg. After being expelled from school, Peter's parents punish him by locking Peter in the basement, concealed behind a refrigerator. Inside the basement, Peter discovers a pit covered with a grate.Devine visits to check up on Peter, but is chased away and intimidated by Mark, who has a gash on his arm that he claims is from doing remodeling work on the house. Eventually, Peter is let out of the basement and reconnects with Sarah, who claims that she is Peter's older sister, having been locked away by their parents after deciding that they didn't want her anymore. Sarah convinces Peter that his parents are planning to kill her and that they will imprison him in the walls. His only chance, to avoid sharing her fate, is to kill his parents, which he does by slipping rat poison into their soup at dinner. Both parents try to stop him, but they succumb to the poisoning before they manage to do so, with Carol warning him to \"not let her out\".Peter unlocks another hidden door, located behind the grandfather clock in the parent's bedroom. Sarah crawls out, although it is dark she does not seem human. Sarah reveals to Peter that she has been deceiving and manipulating him into exacting revenge on his parents for locking her away, and that she resents Peter for being able to live a normal life. Brian and his cousins then show up at the house, planning to get revenge on Peter, but they are all killed by Sarah. Devine also shows up, summoned to the house by a phone call from Peter, and the two of them manage to imprison Sarah back in the pit of the basement, but Sarah warns Peter that she will eventually escape, and that she will always haunt him.",

        "synopsis": "The film opens with a tow truck driver, Gary (Eben Moss-Bachrach) arriving at the home of Maddie Barker (Jennifer Lawrence) to take her car away. Maddie comes out and tries to appeal to Gary's feelings, as they were previously in a relationship until she ghosted him. Her efforts are ruined by another guy she hooked up with the previous night coming out in his underwear and groping her. Gary takes the car away despite Maddie's protests since she's an Uber driver.Maddie roller blades to catch up to Gary and stops when he tries to buy breakfast at a local diner. She tries to lower the car and drive off, but the car is still hooked to the truck, so she clumsily tries to pull out until Gary raises the car back up. Maddie ends up getting arrested and put on probation as a result of her actions, and she is also told she owes a lot in back taxes, so she is in danger of losing her house.Maddie also works as a bartender at a waterside place in Montauk, New York where she has lived all her life. She works with her best friend Sara (Natalie Morales) and hangs out with her and her husband Jim (Scott MacArthur). Maddie is noted by her boss as having an attitude when she gets into an argument with a customer who tries to buy a drink before the bar is open. On their break, Sara shows Maddie a job listing from a rich family asking for someone to \"date\" their son before he goes off to college, and in exchange, they are giving away a Buick Regal. Maddie realizes \"date\" means sex but decides to go along with it because she has no other options, and she wants to exploit the rich since they're taking her house.The next day, Maddie roller blades down a road and arrives at the home of the Becker family and meets the parents, Laird (Matthew Broderick) and Allison (Laura Benanti). They discuss their teenage son Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), who is set to go to Princeton in the fall but is very awkward and shy with little to no friends, and he spends his days in his room playing video games. While they were hoping for someone closer to Percy's age (Maddie is age 32, Percy is age 19), Maddie convinces them that she is the right woman for the job. However, Laird and Allison tell Maddie that Percy cannot know about their arrangement.Laird and Allison tell Maddie to find Percy working at a dog shelter. She wears a form-fitting dress to attempt to seduce him and pretends to want to adopt a dog. Percy shows her a former police dog named Milo that was let go from the force for becoming addicted to cocaine. Percy starts to get nervous as Maddie comes on too strong and tries to leave early, but Maddie offers him a ride home after borrowing Jim's van. When she brings Percy to her house, he pulls out a can of mace and sprays her in the face. After Maddie painfully explains that she just thought he was attractive, Percy says he just wants to go on a proper date, to which Maddie agrees. Maddie later brings the van back to Jim and Sara, telling them that Percy is \"unfuckable\".That evening, Maddie brings Percy to a bar where she knows the waitress and gets him a Long Island iced tea, which he hates. A guy named Travis (Quincy Dunn-Baker) shows up, as he apparently used to date Maddie. He shows off his wedding ring and says that Maddie running out on him was the best thing that ever happened to him, and warns Percy not to get attached to her.Afterwords, Maddie goes with Percy to the beach for a skinny-dipping session. While he is reluctant, Maddie coaxes him to join her. Minutes later, three drunk teens show up and steal their clothes, which contain their wallets, phones, and keys, so Maddie emerges from the water completely nude and proceeds to fight all three teens (two guys and a girl) before they relent and give her back their stuff. When Maddie goes back in the water, Percy is disturbed by her violent confrontation with the teenagers and tells her there is something wrong with her. Maddie walks out of the water, gets dressed, goes to her car to start it and drive away, but Percy is still nude and demands his phone back. When Maddie won't give it back, he hops onto the hood of her car, and she proceeds to drive with him hanging on (stark nude). The cops see them and pursue, but Maddie fears she will lose her license if she is caught, so she drives quickly and manages to run across train tracks before a train can hit them, allowing her to lose the cops.Maddie brings Percy back to her house in another attempt to seduce him. She tries to do a sexy dance for him, and then has him try to do the same until she sees a rash on his back, which he attributes to anxiety. Maddie applies lotion to his back as he starts to open up about his history, including the fact that his classmates made fun of him for sleeping in his parents' bedroom and spreading rumors that he was having sex with them, which is why he doesn't like to go out. Maddie also opens up about an embarrassing memory to Percy.The next day, a former classmate named Doug Khan (Hasan Minhaj) shows up at Maddie's house, as he is now a Realtor and wants to sell her house for full price. Maddie turns him away, as she still plans to save the house.Percy asks Maddie to spend the day with her for a real date, to which she agrees. They go to an arcade and win prizes before getting kicked out because Maddie was messing with another kid. They go by the lighthouse where Percy asks Maddie to kiss her, and she lets him, though he is a bit awkward with it. She also talks to him about how she never left Montauk and has stayed in the same house as her mother because her father gave it to them along with some money so that they wouldn't bother him and his new family. They then go to meet Percy's former nanny, an adult man named Jody (Kyle Mooney). He suspects something is up with Maddie, though she just hits back that he is creepy for being a male nanny to a teenage boy.Later on, Maddie and Percy go to dinner at a fancy restaurant as part of a little prom date since they both didn't go to their proms. She encourages him to play the piano after he mentions he can play, so he goes up and plays the song \"Maneater\" for the whole restaurant to hear, which earns him cheers and applause. Maddie is also equally impressed. A girl from Percy's school, Natalie (Amalia Yoo), then goes up to offer her praise to him, and she says she is also going to Princeton in the fall. Natalie invites Percy to a party for other Princeton-bound students, though Maddie tries to stop him from going for fear that he will end up sleeping with Natalie or another girl. Despite Maddie's objections, Percy says he wants to go.The two take a limo to the party, and Maddie goes looking for Percy, having to walk among snooty teenagers who think she is too old to be there. Maddie eventually finds Percy in bed with Natalie, but he is sick because he's been drinking and he took an Ibuprofen. She goes to make him throw up until the parents of the kid throwing the party come in to tell Maddie she has to leave. Percy tries to defend her and accidentally ends up punching Maddie in the throat. After they leave, Percy says he is ready to have sex with Maddie in the limo, but after he tells her he loves her, she realizes he is too drunk and refuses to go through with it.Laird and Allison notice that Percy seems more upbeat and extroverted, which he attributes to his new girlfriend. However, Percy tells them that he is no longer going to Princeton because he wants to stay close to Maddie. Allison calls Maddie, who is beginning to have second thoughts about the job. Laird tells her that she can have the car without continuing the relationship to avoid Percy skipping out on Princeton. Unfortunately, Percy is in his parent's car and turns it on, activating the speakers so that he overhears their conversation and hears Maddie mentioning wanting to car without having to sleep with Percy, leaving him heartbroken.Percy then has Maddie come over for lunch to \"meet\" his parents. He starts drinking their wine and begins to act passive-aggressively before going out with his co-worker Crispin (Jordan Mendoza) to bring the Buick out into the woods to mess with it. They throw a rock onto the gas pedal and make it crash into a tree, which falls on top of the car. When Percy returns to the house, he and Maddie then decide to have sex and get it over with, but before he can even get inside her, he ends up ejaculating on her thigh. He says that he knows about everything and doesn't want to see Maddie anymore, saying that she will end up living in Montauk for the rest of her life.Gary later brings Maddie the beaten-up Buick since her name is on the papers. She is forced to continue her Uber duties in her messed-up car while Percy goes back to staying in his room and playing video games. He also won't return any of Maddie's texts or calls. After Maddie finally raises enough money to fix her car and pay off her taxes, she celebrates with Jim and Sara, but they announce to her that they are moving to Florida for the sake of their baby (Sara is pregnant). Maddie is left upset as she realizes that she will be all alone.Maddie later contacts Doug and decides to take him up on his offer to sell her house. She sells it to Jim and Sara so they can stay and raise their baby there, and she is making plans to move to California.Maddie finds out Percy is at a Princeton mixer and goes to find him. He still refuses to speak to her, even as she tries to explain herself. She hops on the hood of his car like he did to her, and he drives off with her hanging on. They end up driving through a beach where Maddie catches fire from a barbecue grill before Percy drives into the water. He panics and looks for Maddie before they tearfully apologize to each other. After they reconcile, Maddie says she is moving to California, and Percy is happy for her. He also tells her it still counts that he lost his virginity to her, despite the contrary.Percy packs his bags and says farewell to Laird and Allison on the day he is set to go to Princeton. Maddie shows up to drive him there before she goes to California, and surprises him by showing that she adopted Milo.",

        "synopsis": "US troops were deployed to Afghanistan in Oct 2001, after the 9/11 attacks. Initially only 1300 troops were assigned, but by December 2011 this had increased to 98,000 troops. 50,000 Afghans were employed as interpreters under the agreement that they would be eligible for Special Immigration Visas and relocation to America.\nThe interpreters are regarded as traitors by the locals and the Taliban for collaborating with the enemy.In March 2018, in the middle of the War in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Special Forces Master Sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his unit are ambushed by a truck bomb attack orchestrated by the Taliban during a routine vehicle inspection at Lashkargah, which claims the life of his interpreter. In need of a replacement, he is introduced to Ahmed Abdullah (Dar Salim), a steadfast yet disliked interpreter, who claims he pursues the job only for money.\nDuring an undercover capture mission, Kinley learns that Ahmed was previously affiliated with the Taliban through the opium trade but had defected when the organization murdered his son.Kinley's unit is tasked with searching of all potential locations with suspected Taliban personnel or IED factories. Ahmed is very well connected locally and tells Kinley that he is searching the wrong locations as US intel is not very good.\nKinley feels that he is putting his team in danger everyday for no output. He speaks to his CO colonel Vokes, who informally asks Kinley to go after targets not fully investigated, a list of whom is supplied by Sgt. Declan O'Brady (Alexander Ludwig).Ahmed later saves Kinley's team from being ambushed by a Taliban unit aided by a compromised Afghan National Army soldier, earning Kinley's respect. Ahmed smelled the ambush when the Afghan solider led them on a particular road, and Ahmed got Kinley to stop the convoy. Satellite pictures reveal a ambush lined up 8 Kilometers down the road.\nKinley's team includes Charlie \"Jizzy\" Crow (Sean Sagar), Joshua \"JJ\" Jung (Jason Wong), Tom 'Tom Cat' Hancock (Rhys Yates), Eduardo \"Chow Chow\" Lopez (Christian Ochoa), Steve Kersher (Bobby Schofield) and Jack \"Jack Jack\" Jackson (James Nelson-Joyce).\nAhmed is shown to be married to Basira (Fariba Sheikhan) with a kid on the way.During another raid to check for a possible insurgent arms cache about 120 kilometers (74 miles) north of Bagram Air Base, Kinley's unit is attacked by Taliban reinforcements, who kill everyone except for him and Ahmed. Kinley's unit has requested air support when they discovered arms, but air cover was 15 minutes out when they were attacked. The duo manages to escape on a Taliban truck, killing several Taliban fighters in the process.\nThe truck gets a flat, and Kinley cannot contact his base as the radio is out of range. Kinley and Ahmed are forced to abandon the truck and escape on foot, killing their pursuers in the process.\nThe helicopters from base reach the original location and find 40 Taliban bodies and the bodies of the dead US soldiers minus Ahmed and Kinley.Whilst attempting to return to the airbase by navigating through the mountainous Afghan terrain, they are once again ambushed by insurgents, who manage to wound Kinley, before clubbing him with a rifle butt, incapacitating him. Ahmed manages to kill the Taliban and resolves to take Kinley back to the air base.\nReceiving help from some sympathetic Afghans, Ahmed evades the Taliban hunting them, carrying Kinley over the country's treacherous mountain topography. Several days later Ahmed and Kinley are near Bagram but are attacked by Taliban fighters; Ahmed kills the fighters but is shortly thereafter apprehended by U.S. troops.Three weeks later, Kinley, having been repatriated to his home in Santa Clarita, California, is completely unaware of how he was saved, but understands Ahmed's role in it. Kinley married to his wife Caroline (Emily Beecham) and has 2 kids.\nUpon learning that Ahmed and his family were forced to move underground owing to the duo's escapade having become local folklore (The Taliban have put a heavy price on Ahmed's head and is on their top 10 most wanted list), Kinley attempts to procure U.S. visas for them for over a month, but in vain.\nEmotionally tormented and rendered near sleepless by his inability to repay his indebtedness towards Ahmed, Kinley finally resolves to save him himself, enlisting the assistance of his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Vokes (Jonny Lee Miller), to procure the visas.Returning to Afghanistan under the alias of Ron Kay, Kinley meets with Parker (Antony Starr), a private military contractor, who promises to provide support on the condition that the former locates Ahmed first. But Kinley has to find Ahmed alone.\nMeanwhile Ahmed is being actively hunted by the Taliban, and he has to move frequently with his family to survive.Kinley meets Ahmed's brother Ali, a Taliban supplier who manages to smuggle Kinley across their territory; in the process, he kills two insurgents after nearly being caught at a road checkpoint, which alerts the Taliban with the sound of gunfire that echoes through the mountains.\nVokes informs Kinley that the visas have been processed and are with Parker. Finally arriving at Ahmed's hideout, Kinley persuades him and his family to accompany him to the U.S. Meanwhile, Parker deduces Kinley's true identity; realizing the danger that the duo is in due to their value to the Taliban, he arranges for an AC-130 gunship and an Apache attack helicopter to provide air support. Concurrently, the Taliban mount an attack on Kinley, who manages to escape with Ahmed's family to the nearby Darunta Dam which is the extraction point designated by Parker.Cornered by approaching Taliban units, the duo engages them in a protracted gunfight, which ends when they run out of ammunition. However, the AC-130 and Apache helicopter arrive and wipe out the attackers. Parker arrives from the other end of the dam with a relief column of anti-Taliban technical personnel. He tells Kinley he would have supported his mission gratis had he known upfront it was him. Escorted back to Bagram, the group boards an Airbus A400M leaving Afghanistan.The film's ending title states that in the aftermath of the Taliban's recapture of Afghanistan, over 300 Afghan interpreters affiliated with the U.S. military were murdered by the organization, with thousands more still in hiding.",

        "synopsis": "Father Gabriele Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, and an earthy, humorous, practical man at times, arrives at a small village in Italy where a man is allegedly possessed by a spirit. Along with the local priest he enters the room where the man was tied up. While exorcising the man, he refers to the spirit as Satan and sends it into a pig which was brought in for the exorcism. As soon as the spirit enters the pig, Amorth shoots it with a shotgun.This incident gets him in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors. One tribunal member is a friendly African bishop, Lumumba, but one is a vicious American cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of exorcism and even demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist, and that he did not perform an exorcism, but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally-disturbed man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.After this, the Pope assigns him to visit a possessed little boy named Henry in Spain. Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy travel to Spain from America to take possession of a mysterious old abbey which was Henry's father's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident, with Henry also present. The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident. Workmen, who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave after a sinister fire. Henry starts behaving bizarrely; brain tests show nothing abnormal.Henry, satanically possessed, asks for a priest; the local Father Esquibel arrives, but Henry abuses him and says, \"Wrong priest.\" Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel says he has heard of Amorth, but hasn't read his books; Amorth says, \"They're good books.\" Esquibel makes mistakes as a junior exorcist at first, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him.The duo make various attempts to exorcise Henry, without success. Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood, but he convinces her to pray.In Rome, the Pope is taken sick while reading documents about the Spanish case, and is hospitalized. Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous. He finds that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition was possessed while being an exorcist, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils, including the Inquisition. Amorth also finds the Church covered this up, and eventually finds the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.Amorth and Esquibel reveal to each other their own, and absolve each other's, sins or traumas: that Amorth has guilt from surviving World War II as an Italian partisan, and that a mentally-ill woman asked Amorth's help, and committed suicide when he did not help her enough; and Esquibel had extramarital intercourse with young women. While this helps them bond, they are still unable to exorcise Henry, and they have horrible visions of the women with whom they failed; the exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Henry's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon, and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled Amorth and Esquibel. The Pope recovers, as does Henry.The triumphant duo visit Rome, and find the skeptical American bishop has taken leave in Guam, and been replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive of mysterious events; Lumumba tells them they will be helping go to hundreds of other evil sites, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil. Amorth joyfully says, \"We're going to Hell!\" Finally, words on the screen narrate biographical details about Amorth's papal-exorcist career, including that he has written many books, and \"The books are good.\"An after-credits photo of the real Amorth sticking out his tongue appears, along with his birth and death dates.",

        "synopsis": "Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI) executive Cynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) sends a squad to hunt down rogue scientist Baxter Stockman (Giancarlo Esposito), who has created a Mutagenic ooze with which he intends to form his own mutant animal family, starting with a housefly.Baxter is interrupted by Cynthia's strike force and killed in the resulting explosion, while the mutagen falls into the sewers of New York City. The mutant housefly escapes.\nThe mutagen turns four turtle brothers-Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon) and Donatello (Micah Abbey) and a rat named Splinter (Jackie Chan) into humanoid mutants, whereupon Splinter adopts the turtles. Splinter distrusts humanity-particularly after one encounter where he and the turtles were chased away by humans after Splinter took them to Times Square for their first foray into the human world-and trains his sons in the art of Ninjutsu, instructing them to only leave their sewer home to steal supplies.\nOver the years, the Turtles long to live with and like humans their age, much to Splinter's dismay. Splinter had taught the Turtles not to interact with humans, as he knew that humans would never accept anyone who doesn't look like them. But, regardless, the turtles were obsessed with the human world and want to live a normal life like other humans.Leonardo is the leader of the group, but the other turtles done take him seriously and tend to ignore his advice to stay conservative and not take unnecessary risks by exposing themselves.Fifteen years later, the Turtles were practicing on a rooftop when they hit a person on the street with their Ninja Star. Fortunately, the star hit her helmet, and while she argued with the turtles, her scooter is stolen. The turtles decide to help her as this was their fault.\nThey follow the scooter to a warehouse and defeat a gang of criminals to recover a stolen moped belonging to a teenager named April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri). This was the first instance that the turtles got into a fight and gained some confidence in their abilities.\nThe turtles reveal themselves and their origins to April. April, an aspiring journalist struggling to move past a viral incident of vomiting on camera, has been investigating a series of robberies of TCRI technology by a criminal known as \"Superfly\" (Ice Cube). April says that with her articles, she can help change the public perception of the turtles.\nCynthia responds to the thefts by putting tracking devices on all her equipment.The Turtles plan to stop Superfly and, through April's reporting, win public acceptance as heroes. The turtle star by attacking hired crews who have been conducting the heists on behalf of the Superfly.\nThey intercept a piece of stolen technology and meet Superfly under the Brooklyn Bridge, discovering that he is not only a mutant himself, but leader of a mutant gang (which includes Rocksteady (John Cena), Bebop (Seth Rogen), Wingnut (Natasia Demetriou), Ray Fillet (Austin Post), Leatherhead (Rose Byrne), Genghis Frog (Hannibal Buress), Mondo Gecko (Paul Rudd) and Scumbug). Ecstatic to meet fellow mutants, the Turtles bond with Superfly and the others and he reveals their creation at the hands of Stockman, explaining that they evaded TCRI and are living on an abandoned ship in Staten Island.\nHe then reveals that he plans to use the stolen technology to mutate every animal on Earth and create a world where mutants have dominance over humans. The Superfly plans to use to his own blood to create a weapons version of the ooze and launch it into the atmosphere. In his plan, the humans would becomes pets or source of fuel for the mutants.The Turtles try to intervene, but the gang escapes with the equipment while a tracker TCRI installed on the equipment falls back with the Turtles, allowing them to be captured. At TCRI headquarters, Cynthia extracts the Turtles' mutagen, but April arrives with Splinter to rescue them. Cynthia wanted to use the turtle DNA to create a Mutagen that would allow her to create an army of super soldiers with hybrid human animal characteristics like with Dolphins, Eagles and Snakes.Splinter and the turtles head to Superfly's hideout to stop his machine.\nAt the gang's hideout, Splinter and the Turtles convince Superfly and the gang that their plan for domination will make them no better than the worst of humanity, and together they turn on Superfly, destroying his machine.\nHowever, the ooze falls into the water, combining marine wildlife with Superfly, who then transforms into a gigantic whale-like Kaiju after grabbing animals from a nearby zoo. He attacks the city, and the Turtles and other mutants attempt to stop him but are assumed by the public to be fellow monsters.Leonardo finds his voice as a leader while April overcomes her anxiety and commandeers a news broadcast to explain the mutants' good intentions and the citizens of New York come to their aid. With the help of the citizens and other mutants, the Turtles drop a canister of TCRI retro-mutagen into Superfly's blowhole, turning him back into a collection of normal animals. Reconciling with Splinter, the Turtles, April, and the mutants are celebrated by the city. The mutants soon move into the sewers with them.Splinter and Scumbug fall in love and the Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are all embraced as heroes. While the Turtles and April enjoy themselves at prom, they are under surveillance from Cynthia (holding the now non-mutated Superfly captive), who plans to recapture the Turtles by enlisting the aid of the mysterious Shredder.",

        "synopsis": "Two years after Thaddeus Sivana's defeat, Hespera (Helen Mirren) (The oldest daughter of Atlas, who has elemental abilities) and Kalypso (Lucy Liu) (The middle daughter of Atlas, who has the power of chaos), two of the daughters of the Titan Atlas, break into the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece to steal the Wizard's broken staff (The staff can channel the guilt of all Gods).\nThey take it to the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou), imprisoned in the Gods' Realm, and force him to repair the staff and reactivate its powers.In Philadelphia, Billy Batson (Zachary Levi) and his \"Shazamily\" of foster siblings save people on the collapsing Benjamin Franklin Bridge, but are called out for its destruction. The foster siblings all got their own superpowers after killing the seven demons, who were conjured when Wizard died.The group is drifting apart at home as they grow up and have their own personal interests, in particular the eldest girl, Mary (Grace Caroline Currey) (Billy's mature and academically-driven older foster sister), who resents that her secret life as a superhero has prevented her from going to college. Billy is worried about being kicked out of the Vasquez family when he \"ages out\" of the foster system.\nEugene Choi (Ross Butler and Ian Chen) (Billy's younger foster brother who is an obsessive gamer) & Darla Dudley (Meagan Good and Faithe Herman) (Billy's good-natured younger foster sister).In a dream, the Wizard warns Billy about the daughters, prompting the Shazamily to begin researching them. The Wizard says that the barrier between the worlds has been brought down and the daughter's of Atlas will attack Earth soon. The foster siblings find that the daughters guard the tree of life, which grows Golden apples, that contain the seeds of life which gave birth to their realm. The tree is protected by a dragon. They also find that the Titan Atlas forged the staff with magical powers to give and take away super powers from anyone. The council of magic stole the staff from Atlas and used it to take away Atlas's powers. The staff had the power of 7 Gods (Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury). Then the wizards used the staff to encase the God Realm in a magical sphere, sealing it forever.\nWhen Shazam broke the staff (to stop Sivana from doing bad stuff with it), he broke the magical sphere around the God Realm, thus freeing the daughters of Atlas.Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer and Adam Brody) (Billy's physically disabled foster brother, who is a fan of superheroes), still bullied at school, falls for a new girl named Anne (Rachel Zegler) (The youngest daughter of Atlas, who has reality manipulation abilities), to whom he shows off his superhero self.\nHespera and Kalypso arrive with the staff and steal Freddy's powers, and Anne is revealed to be their youngest sister, Anthea. Billy and the Shazamily attempt to save Freddy, but the daughters kidnap him and place an indestructible dome around the city, trapping everyone inside. Freddy is imprisoned with the Wizard in the Gods' Realm. The Daughters reveal that they want revenge because the Wizard killed their father.Meanwhile, the Shazamily enter the Rock of Eternity, where they encounter a sentient pen named Steve, which they use to draft a letter to Hespera as a negotiation for Freddy's release. Anthea likes Freddy and protects him from her sisters wrath during his time at the God Realm.Billy meets Hespera, and, while the meeting is initially cordial, she and Kalypso soon fight the Shazamily. Hespera reveals her plan to take back the powers each of the foster siblings and use the staff to restore the powers of magic to the God Realm.\nPedro (D. J. Cotrona and Jovan Armand) (Billy's older foster brother, who is openly gay, shy and sensitive) loses his powers during the fight, while Hespera is captured and taken to the Rock. Hespera easily breaks out and steals the Golden Apple, the seed of the Tree of Life.\nMeanwhile, Freddy and the Wizard attempt to escape the Gods' Realm with a sympathetic Anthea's help, just as Hespera returns with the Apple. The Daughters argue as Hespera and Anthea want to use the Apple to revive their realm, while Kalypso wishes to plant it on Earth to destroy it. Freddy steals the Apple but is discovered. Billy and the Shazamily show up, and Freddy reacquires his powers.Billy and the Shazamily emerge with the Wizard in the Vasquez home, where they reveal their secret identities to their foster parents. Kalypso appears with a dragon named Ladon to acquire the Apple. All but Billy lose their powers in the skirmish, while Kalypso retrieves the Apple and uses it to plant the Tree at Citizens Bank Park, which spawns monsters to attack the city. Hespera and Anthea object to their sister's destructive plan, but Kalypso mortally wounds Hespera and de-powers Anthea. Billy, in despair, asks the Wizard to revoke his powers, but the Wizard assures him he is a true hero who is worthy of them.Heeding the Wizard's words, Billy flies off to stop Kalypso, while the Shazamily enlists the help of unicorns (Darla lures the Unicorns from the underworld to the Earth using skittles) to fend off the other monsters. Billy persuades a dying Hespera to help him stop Kalypso.\nRealizing the dome reacts violently to his lightning, Billy lures Kalypso to the Park while Hespera shrinks the dome to contain them. Billy plan is to overload the staff with lightening and make a bomb that explodes and kills everything inside the dome.\nBilly fights Kalypso and Ladon before killing them both by overloading the staff with electricity, destroying the Tree and Kalypso's army with them, at the cost of his own life. Hespera acknowledges Billy as a true god before succumbing to her wounds.Anthea takes Billy's grieving family to the Gods' Realm for his burial. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), the last living being with godly powers, appears and repairs the staff, imbuing it with her power and using it to revive the Gods' Realm, restore Anthea's powers, and resurrect Billy. Billy in turn uses the staff to restore his siblings' powers. The Shazamily rebuild their home while Anthea and the Wizard take up residence on Earth.In a mid-credits scene, Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) and John Economos (Steve Agee) attempt to recruit Billy into the Justice Society on behalf of Amanda Waller. In a post-credits scene, a still-incarcerated Sivana (Mark Strong) encounters Mister Mind (David F. Sandberg) once again, infuriated that he has not begun enacting their plan.",

Tom's cover is a field technician for a Swiss communications contractor.\nHis mission is successful, and the malware causes the facility to self-destruct.At the same time, the Iranian government has been monitoring a British journalist Luna Cujai (Nina Toussaint-White) in Iran. She receives evidence from a whistle blower of the CIA's ongoing sabotage of Iran's nuclear programs. After the facility is destroyed, she is arrested by an Iranian security agency. She tells the Iranians that she suspects a link between the facility's destruction and a Belgian contractor, because its contracts tend to be next to sensitive government sites.\nTom is married, but his wife in London is asking for a divorce. Tom has a daughter Ida who is graduating school and is disappointed since Tom is never there in her life.Tom leaves Iran on route to London via Dubai. While in Dubai, his flight to London is delayed. During his extended layover he is texted by and visits his CIA handler, Roman Chalmers (Travis Fimmel). Roman claims to have delayed the flight to force this meeting. Tom accepts Roman's lucrative CIA contract for a job in Herat, Afghanistan, because it will pay enough to cover his daughter's medical university expenses. The job is to destroy Iran's entire nuclear program before they have the chance to build a bomb. The mission is to build a landing strip in Taybad (which is near the Afghan-Iran border), by entering Iran from the Afghan border city of Herat.After he arrives in Herat, due to an intelligence leak, the global news media names Tom as the operative responsible for the destruction of the nuclear facility. With his cover now blown, the mission in Herat is aborted. Roman directs Tom, and his Afghan-American translator (Mohammad \"Mo\" Doud (Navid Negahban)) to an extraction point in Kandahar. The flight for Kandahar leaves in 30 hours.\nMo himself is an American, but had accepted the mission from Romain, to search for his wife's sister in Herat, who used to be a teacher in a school.

Gale called Sam unstable and a born killer.Sam's therapist Christopher Stone (Henry Czerny) is murdered by Ghostface, who steals Sam's file and leaves behind a mask worn in the Hollywood killings. Wayne suspects that Sam killed her therapist since she had admitted to liking killing Richie and that was also in his session notes, which are now stolen.Mindy theorizes that the killer is following the rules of film franchises, specifically the rule that anyone can die while the franchise will still continue. Ghostface attacks the group in the sisters' apartment, murdering Anika and seemingly killing Quinn. Sam's boyfriend Danny (Josh Segarra) helps the others escape and Ghostface leaves behind a mask worn in the Windsor College killings.

They were responsible for defaming Sam online and plan to frame her for their killing spree. Sam and Tara gain the upper hand and fight off the Bailey family, with Tara stabbing Ethan and Sam killing Quinn, while briefly knocking Wayne unconscious.

        "synopsis": "In the Italian Alps, an MI6 team is tasked with extracting potential asset and arms dealer, Mulvaney. Rachel Stone (Gal Gadot), officially in the tech support team in a van with Bailey (Paul Ready), is called upon to enter the ski lodge casino to be near enough to hack into security's encryption key. Rachel is not a field agent but has to do this as the internet is not working and physically hacking into the phone of the head of security is the only way to gain access.To maintain her cover while in the casino Stone plays one hand of blackjack, then apparently disappearing. Field agents Parker (Jamie Dornan) and Yang (Jing Lusi) are given access to the restricted gambling area. They find that people are betting on the body count of an actual combat between US Navy seals and some terrorists. Someone has found a way to hack into military grade encryption.\nTheir plan to inject Mulvaney to fake a heart attack is thwarted by his bodyguard. However, Parker is able to isolate and take him on a cable car.\nTheir communications are infiltrated by Keya Dhawan (Alia Bhatt), who reveals that she knew that the MI6 were coming.Stone and Yang can see that more of Mulvaney's men are converging at the base of the cable car station. There is no way that Parker survives unless MI6 gets there first.\nMeanwhile, Stone feigns a twisted ankle, so the MI6 goes on without her.Stone reconnects with Charter, the secret peace-keeping organization, to help the MI6 team incognito. Hoping to prevent Mulvaney's security team from taking out Parker, Jack (Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer) guides Stone so she can get ahead of the cable car. Jack helps Stone get a parachute and ski down the mountain ahead of the cable car.\nStone takes out the six-man security team, hiding the bodies. However, Mulvaney takes cyanide before they can stop him.Back in London, the MI6 team are reprimanded for botching the job. Later that night, as the team wind down together, they speculate about the rumored Charter. Charter is rumored to be a group of ex-intelligence operatives who answer only to themselves. Highly trained agents working together to keep peace in the world. Doing things their governments never allowed them to do.\nMI6 believes that Keya works for Charter. MI6 is worried that someone has hacked military grade encryption and that is their next mission.Stone goes to Charter headquarters where the head Nomad (Sophie Okonedo) criticizes her actions. Charter has found Keya, who is the hacker who broke the military grade encryption. She was an orphan in Pune, when a Billionaire Niam Kharche discovered her talent and took her under his wing. But then Keya fell in with a bunch of criminals and she is 22 years old now.\nKeya had set up the casino gambit to lure Mulvaney. Mulvaney was tracking a Quantum Computer called \"The Heart\" capable for hacking anything, anywhere.Charter have located Keya in Lisbon. The plan is to leak the location to MI6 and have Stone's MI6 team to pursue her.\nIn Lisbon, the MI6 team are ambushed by several people. Although Stone is given an escape route by Jack, she opts to stay and save her MI6 team. She blows her cover in doing so, only for Parker to kill the other team members. He paralyzes Stone as he says that he's going after \"The Heart.\" Parker says that he and Keya knew that the Charter had infiltrated the MI6 and Parker's mission was to find out who. Parker reveals that Mulvaney told him that \"The Heart\" is the source of the Charter's powers. Its modeling is so accurate that it can predict the future. If you own the Heart, you own the World. Only a Charter member can reveal where The Heart is located.Parker injects Rachel with a hacking device. As Rachel is discovered by the Charter recovery team, she is taken to their HQ. Where, using the device inside Rachel, Keya is able to hack into Charter's systems and access The Heart. Rachel regains consciousness, stabs herself to eject the device and destroys it. But the systems were hacked for 3 minutes and 45 seconds.Jack reveals that The Heart is 85,000 feet up in the atmosphere in a blimp called The Locker. Rachel recommends shutting it down, as they don't know what Keya is capable of.\nNomad takes Rachel off the case. She says that had Rachel escaped, like she was told, everyone would still be alive, and The Heart would have been safe.Charter assigns names to agents like a deck of cards.\nNomad, the King of Hearts, meets the other Kings. King of Clubs (BD Wong), King of Diamonds (Glenn Close) and King of Spades (Mark Ivanir).\nThe Kings reveal that Parker was in Chechnya in 2015. He was working for MI6 stopping delivery of weapons to a Chechen warlord. But he was trapped, and his entire team was killed. Charter was monitoring and couldn't allow the weapons into Chechen hands. The Kings ordered a drone strike, that took out the weapons. They thought Parker had died, but he survived.\nParker knows it was Charter who ordered the drone strike and is out for revenge.Rachel works on her own and uses Keya hacks to trace her back. Rachel tracks Keya in West Africa and she is going after The Locker. Keya used her hack to plant a code that will control the Locker and drop it to 40,000 feet. Parker will have 8 minutes to take The Heart, before Charter regains control and takes The Locker back up to 85,000 feet.\nCharter detects the hack, but there is no agent within 500 miles of the Locker. Rachel had already traveled to Africa was in the air, skydiving her way to The Locker. Meanwhile Keya and Parker used a chopper to get to The Locker and were already inside.Rachel manages to get on board The Locker. As Rachel attacks Parker, Keya steals The Heart. Parker manages to escape, but Rachel gets hold of Keya and they both plummet to the ground as Parker blows up The Locker. Rachel uses Keya's parachute to land them both safely in the middle of the Senegal desert. Parker has The Heart, but it is useless without Keya as she has put her bio-metrics on it.\nRachel refuses to kill Keya, even though Keya knows that's the logical play. Keya says that Niam conducted medical experiments that killed her parents. She wants to use The Heart to expose all Billionaires like Niam.\nRachel offers that Charter can take down Niam, without Keya having to destroy the Charter. Rachel puts a tracker on Keya.They reach a town, where they are shot at by mercenaries paid by Parker's men. Rachel manages to escape, but Keya is captured. Rachel is rescued by another Charter agent called Six of Hearts.\nRachel is taken to Iceland, and Rachel informs Nomad, and they plan a strike on Parker. If Parker gets the Heart online, it will finish The Charter.As Rachel gets to Iceland, Parker plugs in The Heart and Keya activates it. Parker uses The Heart to kill King of Diamonds. They also find King of Hearts and her team in a bunker outside of London. Parker seals off the bunker and shuts off their ventilation system. Keya is distraught since the plan was to expose the Charter and not kill people.\nKing of Clubs also lands in Iceland with a strike team but is being tracker by Parker.Keya contacts Rachel secretly and reveals that she found her tracker. Parker is using it to lure Clubs and Rachel to a wrong location and trap them. Keya says that Rachel was right about Parker and sends her coordinates.\nRachel manages to escape, but King of Clubs and his entire team is destroyed as Parker remote detonates an explosive.\nKeya locks out Parker from The Heart. Rachel makes her way to Parker's location and has 50 minutes to save Nomad.Rachel reaches Parker's real location and fights her way in. Keya helps Rachel in the fight against Parker and Rachel manages to shoot Parker down.

        "synopsis": "65 million years ago, on the planet Somaris, pilot Mills (Adam Driver) convinces his wife Alya (Nika King) that he should take on a two-year space expedition to earn the money needed to treat their daughter Nevine's (Chloe Coleman) illness. Mills will earn thrice his normal salary for this expedition.\nDuring the journey, his spaceship, the Zoic, is hit by a mass of asteroids and crash-lands on an alien planet, which unbeknownst to him, is actually Earth. All the passengers were in a Cryogenic induced sleep and Mills was the only being awake as the pilot of the ship.With his ship damaged beyond repair, he finds that his passengers have been killed and contemplates suicide until he finds a lone survivor, a young girl named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt). Mills sends a distress beacon for rescue and decides to take care of Koa. However, they have difficulty communicating due to differing languages and a broken translator.\nMills surveys the area surrounding the ship and finds skeletons of dinosaurs and steam jet geysers.Mills later discovers a functioning escape shuttle from the Zoic has landed on top of a mountain, 15 kilometers away. To encourage Koa to follow him, Mills lies about her family being atop the mountain, when in reality they perished in the crash. The pair quickly realize the planet is home to dangerous and aggressive alien creatures, which turn out to be Earth's dinosaurs. As Mills protects Koa, they begin to bond.\nMills has a device that tells them what is safe to eat. Mills finds some poison berries that he stops Koa from eating.Koa watches several video messages sent by Nevine. The two are attacked by an unidentified monster, which Mills manages to wound before hiding in a cave. An insect gets into Koa's mouth and starts to suffocate her, but Mills finds it in time and extracts the insect. They are pushed deeper into the cave by a T-Rex who attacks them from outside the cave. Mills manages to injure the creature with his gun.\nMills hands a few bombs to Koa, just in case she finds herself alone.They enter a narrow shaft to escape the cave.\nAfter a rockfall inside the narrow shaft separates them, Mills is trapped inside the cave, while Koa falls outside the cave system into the open jungle. Koa finds a large dinosaur tooth lying in the jungle, which is also very sharp. She laces the tooth with a paste from the poison berries.\nMills is attacked by an Oviraptor and Koa is attacked by a raptor-like creature which she traps in a fallen tree log; she uses bombs Mills had given her to kill the dinosaur.Mills kills the Oviraptor with his gun and escapes the cave, however he falls into quicksand while searching for Koa. Koa rescues him and they continue up the mountain. However, Mills discovers that a huge asteroid, the same one whose debris his ship crashed into, will strike Earth in less than 12 hours.The two reach the escape shuttle, but Koa is angry when she discovers that Mills lied to her. Mills opens up to Koa about losing Nevine, who had died of her illness while he was away, and promises to protect her. Upon learning rescue is on the way, the two board the escape shuttle, but the asteroid's debris causes it to fall down the mountain. The shuttle cannot launch as it is in the wrong position and facing upside down.Mills and Koa manage to fend off a pair of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Mills goes outside the shuttle as he finds a gun lying on the ground, but the gun wont charge and he has to hide inside the shell of his ship.\nKoa lures the T-Rexes away from Mills using a projection of Nevine from one of her videos. Mills uses the distraction to shoot down one of the T-Rex, but the other understands the ruse and attacks Koa. Mills charges his gun and shoots the T-Rex dead and saves Koa.But the same creature they injured earlier at the cave, which turns out to be an enormous quadrupedal Theropod, also attacks. Mills asks Koa to launch the ship, and runs away.\nMills manages to lure it toward a large geyser while Koa stabs it in the eye with a large dinosaur tooth that she coated in poison berries earlier.\nThe pair escapes just in time as the asteroid strikes Earth, causing a cataclysmic event and the extinction of the dinosaurs. With the pod set to meet up with a rescue vessel, the two relax and fly off into the stars.In closing titles, the evolution of Earth is shown, at the spot where Mills and Koa left, through an ice age until the present day.",

Rourke suspects they are all in an elaborate heist and races to the targeted safe deposit box. Rourke enters the bank vault on the pretext of opening a safety deposit box account with the Bank.\nInside the box assigned to him, he only finds a picture of Minnie with the message \"Find Lev Dellrayne\" written on it.The guards and the civilians work in cohesion to steal a specific safety deposit box from the vault and deliver it back to the mysterious man.The mysterious man escapes, but Rourke is now convinced the heist has something to do with his daughter's disappearance. Rourke had come face to face with the mysterious man who tells Rourke that Lyle Terry was not aware of his actions, when he took away Minnie. The mysterious man walked away when he realized that Rourke already had the picture of Minnie, and he threw away the safety deposit box.A trace run by Nicks on the anonymous tip-off call leads Rourke to the address of fortune-teller Diana Cruz (Alice Braga). Cruz tells Rouke that the mysterious man from the bank is named \"Lev Dellrayne\" (William Fichtner) and that he and Cruz are both the escaped \"Hypnotics\".\nFurther proof emerges when Dellrayne sends a random biker to attack Cruz and Rourke, and the biker kills himself after failing in his mission.\nCruz reveals that powerful hypnotists (people with the ability to influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Telepaths only read the mind; Hypnotics can reshape its reality) were trained by a secretive government \"Division\" to control people's minds. She also tells Rourke that he is mysteriously immune to her own mind control abilities, which she demonstrates by getting Nicks to doing what she wants.\nCruz says that Rourke has a psychic block which could be a result of emotional trauma or even pain of losing his daughter. Only Dellrayne can unlock his block.\nDellrayne was a legend in the Hypnotics community and went rogue. He believes only he could achieve the full potential of the Hypnotics. He wanted to take over the Division. Cruz stood in his way.Dellrayne hypnotizes Nicks into attacking Rourke and Cruz, forcing Cruz to kill him in self-defense. Now seen as the two primary suspects in Nicks' murder, Rourke and Cruz flee to Mexico. Rourke is convinced that Dellrayne is behind Minnie's kidnapping.\nIn Mexico, they learn from a former Division contact of Cruz's named Jeremiah (Jackie Earle Haley) that Dellrayne is searching for \"Domino\", a weapon developed by the Division which was stolen and hidden by Dellrayne when he escaped. Domino was a tool that could control even the most powerful Hypnotic, specifically Dellrayne.Dellrayne then wiped his own memory and left behind \"triggers\" that will prompt him to gradually recall Domino's location and simultaneously increase his regained hypnotic power.\nDellrayne uses his ability to control civilians to pursue Rourke and Cruz from Jeremiah's apartment and into the surrounding city. However, Rourke taps into his own (previously unknown) hypnotic power to stop Dellrayne's control of the civilians, allowing him and Cruz to escape.Rourke and Cruz next seek out River (Dayo Okeniyi), a reclusive Division hacker. He hacks into the Division database and learns that Rourke's former wife, Vivian (Kelly Frye), was a member of the Division. Cruz and River theorize that Rourke must be another Hypnotic whose memory was wiped.\nLater that night, Rourke investigates River's database on his own, learning that Minnie is actually the \"Domino.\" She is the daughter of two powerful hypnotics: Rourke and Vivian. Furthermore, \"Cruz\" is actually Vivian; Rourke's memory of his wife's face had been altered so that he believed \"Cruz\" to be a stranger.\nRourke then realizes that all the events and locations seen up to this point have been hypnotic constructs created within a facility populated by Division agents that have simply acted out the roles of all the people he's met up to this point.\nRourke was protecting Minnie from Vivian and the Division. Vivian wanted Minnie to be trained as a Hypnotic.Vivian and \"Dellrayne\" (The real head of the Division) explain that Minnie was born and raised within the Division, but Rourke escaped with her to stop her from becoming their weapon. Rourke hid Minnie and then wiped his memory, so the Division has been repeatedly putting him through a constructed scenario to make him remember. The scenario of a desperate cop looking for his daughter. They had received Minnie's photograph with the message, in the mail 6 weeks ago, and since then they had been playing the scenario over and over again (This was the 12th time they attempted), trying to get him to remember Minnie's location.\nVivian tries to convince Rourke that she loves Rourke and only wants good for Minnie, but Rourke sees right through her.Rourke's mind is then \"reset,\" bringing him back to the therapy session at the start of the film, but his powers allow him to soon awaken from the construct and escape. He had written something on the notepad, which Nicks finds out.\nHe flees just as the Division realizes that \"Find Lev Dellrayne\" refers not to a person but \"Deer Valley Lane\" - a dead-end road with a single ranch on it.Rourke arrives at the ranch and is reunited with Minnie (Hala Finley) as well as his own foster parents, who have been raising her for the past three years while she gained control of her powers.\nDivision agents invade the ranch, but Minnie uses her power to confuse and disorient them. Minnie restores Vivian's memories, causing Vivan to realize she aided Rourke and Minnie's escape and subsequently wiped her memory so that when Minnie was finally powerful enough to defeat the entire Division at once, Vivian could unwittingly lead them to her.\nRourke and Vivian knew that they could never outrun the Division and the only way to be free is to destroy them completely.Minnie is revealed to be the one who secretly provided the \"Find Lev Dellrayne\" photo to the Division, setting the search in motion. Minnie then forces all the Division agents to kill each other. Minnie, her parents, and Rourke's foster parents celebrate their newfound freedom.",

Even though Doug only keeps him to spite an ex-girlfriend, Reggie is under the impression that Doug loves him and does everything he can to make him happy, much to Doug's chagrin.When Reggie inadvertently destroys Doug's bong, Doug makes several attempts to ditch Reggie, which Reggie views as a game. Losing track of Doug in a city hours away, Reggie meets a street-wise Boston Terrier named Bug who teaches him how to be a stray after he defends him from a Rottweiler and a Doberman. After a night with Bug and his friends: an Australian Shepherd named Maggie and a therapy Great Dane named Hunter, Reggie realizes that Doug does not love him. He decides to get revenge by biting Doug's penis off, and the other strays accompany him for support.During the journey, the group bonds as they get into several situations, culminating in getting caught by Animal Control after a hallucinogenic mushroom-induced high causes them to maul a family of rabbits, which they mistake for toys. During their captivity, Bug admits that he used to have a family of his own but was forced to escape when they tried to euthanize him after he bit the daughter, which caused him to have a mistrust for himself with human kids. In an attempt to escape, the dogs plan to use Hunter's erect penis to hook the kennel keys but are unsuccessful. Then in another attempt to escape, Reggie suggests that every dog defecate on the floor at the same time so when the security guard opens it, they can all run out, in which they are successful. But after escaping the pound, Reggie convinces himself that he is to blame for Doug treating him poorly. This causes Bug to urinate on Reggie's bandana in a fit of anger and Reggie leaves the other strays. Making their way back to the city, Bug, Maggie, and Hunter stumble upon a lost Girl Scout and alert a search and rescue worker to her location.Reggie eventually makes his way back to Doug's house, and after cutting ties with him and before leaving, Doug slams the door in front of him and attempts to slaughter Reggie. The other strays intervene, and, with their help, Reggie successfully rips Doug's penis off. Hunter also defecates in Doug's mouth, and during the altercation, Doug's house is accidentally burned down. Afterward, the strays move on: Maggie begins training as a police dog and starts a relationship with Hunter, the latter returns to being a therapy dog, the Girl Scout adopts Bug, and Reggie chooses to guide new strays",

        "synopsis": "The film opens with Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) in Singapore, calling his daughter Daniela (Haleigh Hekking) as he intends to arrive home in Honolulu to spend time with her for the holiday. Brodie, a former RAF pilot, is flying Trailblazer Airlines Flight 119, and he arrives to meet his co-pilot, Samuel Dele (Yoson An), who informs Brodie that they are going to fly through a storm. Bonnie (Daniella Pineda), the chief flight attendant, informs Brodie that he is needed to meet an RCMP officer (Otis Winston). The officer informs Brodie that they are transporting an accused killer/former French Foreign Legion soldier named Louis Gasparre (Mike Colter).As the flight gets ready for takeoff, we see other guests, such as young social media influencers and a snooty businessman. While in the air, Brodie and Dele talk, with Brodie mentioning how his wife had passed years earlier. As they pass over the South China Sea, the plane encounters heavy turbulence when it passes through the storm. The storm gets worse, leading to the plane suffering damage, and Brodie injures his head in the commotion. The RCMP officer leaves his seat, is thrown about, and dies. A stewardess leaves her seat to assist him and is also killed in the turbulence. Brodie and Dele have to manage control without comms and radar, bringing it to a safer balance. Realizing the damages are too heavy, they have to make an emergency landing. The pilots find an island and make a rough landing.Once everything settles, Brodie has the passengers get out of the plane. He and Dele learn they are on Jolo island, in the Philippines.In New York City, at Trailblazers HQ, the board of directors is met by their crisis manager, Scarsdale (Tony Goldwyn), to try and locate the plane and passengers.Brodie tries to keep Louis away and secured from the other passengers due to his violent history. Brodie works with Dele and Bonnie to keep the passengers calm and to find a way to call for help. Dele tells Brodie that Jolo is operated by violent separatists, meaning they risk putting everyone in danger the longer they are there.The rebels, led by Datu Junmar (Evan Dane Taylor), catch wind of the plane's crash landing and hope to gain from the passengers. Meanwhile, Brodie goes with Louis into the forest to find a way to contact for help.Back in NYC, Scarsdale and the board review Brodie's history file, featuring a video of an incident where Brodie held an aggressive passenger in a chuckhole until he passed out after the man punched Brodie when he tried to calm down an altercation. They learn of Brodie's calls to Trailblazer and his daughter, and are able to identify the plane's location. Scarsdale sends a private mercenary team to rescue the crew and passengers, since he knows of the threat on the island, and the Philippine government is unwilling to help.In Honolulu, Daniela's aunt informs her of the news that her father's plane went down.Brodie and Louis reach a tower where Brodie manages to contact an agent from Trailblazers who doesn't believe him because she claims they have been getting lots of crank calls over the missing flight. Brodie then calls Daniela and attempts to tell her their location before he is attacked by a rebel. Brodie fights the man until he is able to kill him. Upon further inspection of the building, Brodie and Louis see that the rebels used the area to torture and videotape their victims for ransom money.The two rush back to the plane but find that Junmar and his goons have already made it there. A Korean woman attempts to flee, only for one of the rebels to shoot her. Her husband is then brutally decapitated. The rebels proceed to take everyone else hostage while Brodie and Louis hide. Once the rebels leave, the two subdue a remaining rebel and learn that Junmar is taking everyone to a nearby village. Brodie and Louis resolve to follow and rescue everyone.As the two head out to the village, Junmar starts forcing the hostages to state their names and home countries for their ransom video.The mercenary team, led by a man named Shellback (Remi Adeleke ) arrives on the island, but they find nobody near the plane, only the bodies of the RCMP officer and the stewardess, along with a message from Brodie.Brodie and Louis make it to the village and kill some more rebels before locating and freeing the hostages. Everyone gets boarded onto a bus while Brodie offers himself to the rebels, hoping to give the passengers a chance to escape. Junmar and his men beat him and prepare to execute him, but the mercenary team arrives and opens fire on the rebels. With Louis' and the mercenaries' help, Brodie and the passengers escape. After the fight, Junmar finds his brother among the dead, driving his cause against the others to become more personal.The passengers and crew make it back to the plane, while Louis and the mercenaries fight off the rebels, who have followed them. Back at Trailblazers HQ, Trailblazers executive Terry Hampton (Paul Ben-Victor) demands that the plane stay where it is, fearing the consequences for Trailblazer if the damaged plane explodes in midair, but Scarsdale ignores him and tells Brodie to get the plane airborne before they're all killed by the rebels. Louis, who has found the ransom money brought by the mercenary team, chooses to remain on the island since he has no future going back.With most of the first wave of rebels dead, Brodie and Dele make an effort to get the plane moving. Junmar attempts to fire an RPG at the plane, but Brodie lifts it high enough in the air that he kills Junmar by smashing into him with the plane's wheels. The plane is badly damaged, but they head towards a nearby island, Siasi, with an airstrip. With only one engine left, and limited control, Brodie, with Dele's assistance, is able to land safely. Everyone at HQ cheers.After everyone is safely deboarded, Brodie sits down on the steps of the plane and calls Daniela to let her know he is safe and coming home.",

        "synopsis": "Wen, a seven-year-old, is vacationing with her adoptive parents, Eric and Andrew, at their remote cabin in Burlington County, New Jersey.During her stay, Wen is approached by a mysterious stranger named Leonard. Initially charming, Leonard explains that he needs Wen and her parents' help to save the world. While the two spend time together catching grasshoppers, Wen becomes suspicious when three other people show up with makeshift weapons. Wen flees to warn Eric and Andrew but the visitors break into the cabin before tying them up, with Eric sustaining a concussion.Leonard and his companions-Sabrina, Adriane, and Redmond-claim to have never met before this day and have no intention to harm the family, but in the last week, they have been compelled by visions and an unknown power to find the family. The group foresee an upcoming apocalypse in which Leonard claims oceans will rise, a plague will descend, the sky will fall, and finally an unending darkness will descend. This can only be averted if the family kills one of their own as a sacrifice. They are warned that, while they will survive the apocalypse, if they do not choose, they will be doomed to be the last people alive. Eric and Andrew believe the group is lying and the attack is rooted in hate and delusions.When the family refuses to choose, the visitors conduct a strange ritual in which Redmond covers his head with a cloth and they beat him to death with their weapons. Eric, who is concussed, believes he sees a figure of light as Redmond dies. On the TV, media reports devastating tsunamis, which Leonard says is the start of the apocalypse. Andrew comes to believe that Redmond is actually Jeff O'Bannon, a homophobe who assaulted him in a bar years ago, for which he went to prison. Andrew believes O'Bannon tracked him down as revenge. Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane question if Andrew is right and struggle with their guilt, but maintain that they believe their visions. They reveal that Redmond's death has temporarily delayed the apocalypse. The next day, the intruders sacrifice Adriane as Eric and Andrew refuse to choose a sacrifice.The disasters continue as a plague spreads across the globe. Andrew insists the disasters are coincidental and the visitors were anticipating pre-scheduled news broadcasting. Sabrina describes how she and the other visitors were led by their visions and compulsions to find each other online, execute details of their plan such as their weapons, and to continue forward when they wanted to resist. Andrew manages to escape and retrieves his gun from the car and shoots at Sabrina until she runs away. Andrew finds Redmond's wallet and proves to Leonard that he was Jeff. Injured from his attack and their tires slashed, Andrew believes the four came in a truck nearby and locks Leonard in the bathroom. Sabrina breaks into the house, and Andrew fatally injures her. Leonard then tricks Andrew into coming into the bathroom and overpowers him, stealing the gun.Leonard still sacrifices Sabrina, and the broadcasts shows spontaneous plane crashes taking place around the world. Realizing their time is almost up, Leonard takes the three onto the back deck as the sky begins to blacken and lightning begins to set the earth on fire. Before sacrificing himself, Leonard tells them they have only minutes to decide before it is too late and slashes his throat. Eric now believes that the events are real, and the intruders each represent the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Not wanting Wen to grow up in a destroyed world, Eric offers himself as the sacrifice. He claims that he saw a light before the visitors killed Redmond, and that he saw a future of the world still surviving and Wen is grown up, and Andrew is still there for her. Eric feels that they were chosen to sacrifice their family because their family's love was pure. Andrew then reluctantly shoots and kills Eric.Andrew and Wen find the visitor's truck with their belongings that corroborate their stories. They drive to a crowded nearby diner, where news reports on the TV confirm that the disasters have subsided and the world is saved. Returning to the truck, the radio turns on and plays \"Boogie Shoes\" by KC and the Sunshine Band, the song Eric played for them on their drive to the cabin, as the two drive back into the world.",

        "synopsis": "It is New Year's Eve in 2022, and the city of Baltimore is complete with people partying in their apartments or just going about their business. Amidst this chaos, as soon as a round of fireworks goes out, 17 people are shot dead with bullets flying out of nowhere at multiple locations. On the other side of the town, Eleanor Falco (Shailene Woodley), a police officer, is trying to settle a meager squabble at a diner involving an alcoholic homeless woman who refuses to leave the diner when she is paged to reach one of the sites of the shooting.Eleanor arrives at the site, and the police ascertain that all the bullets have been fired from a certain 17th floor apartment in the neighborhood. It is at the precise moment of this discovery the apartment blows up, sending a shock wave of panic among the other residents in the building. All the police personnel immediately rush to the site of destruction. Eleanor, along with one of her colleagues, stands outside the building recording videos of the fleeing residents. There was a possibility that the culprit was in the crowd.Soon, the police and the FBI reach the site and find no trace of the perpetrator. Eleanor, who had by this time climbed the stairs to the 17th floor without a gas mask while resting against one of the walls of the apartment due to ill health, manages to hint at investigating the toilet for any possible evidence of the shooter.Back at the police station, the chief FBI investigator, Geoffrey Lammark (Ben Mendelsohn), arrives and briefs the department about the task they have at hand - finding out the mass shooter - and explains the things they need to keep in mind while carrying on investigations. He particularly fancies Eleanor, who is prompt to tell him that the shooter is unlikely to strike again and why.We get an insight into the lonely life of Eleanor as she returns home that night. However, very early the next morning, she is summoned by Lammark. The latter insists that she assist him in this case because her thought process would be insightful, and she could also serve as the link between the Baltimore Police Department and the FBI in this investigation. Here, they meet Jack Mackenzie (Jovan Adepo), another FBI agent who would be following them closely in finding the shooter. What follows is a lot of brainstorming among the three as they try to understand the possible motive of the attack or the reason why it took place. We also understand that Lammark is under huge duress from the FBI authorities to successfully find the shooter.While Eleanor, Mammark and Mackenzie are still trying to figure out who the killer is, the investigators have narrowed it down to a teenage boy - who has confined himself to his room and watches ISIS videos - as their primary suspect. They proceed to zero down on him, despite Lammark's orders. Unfortunately, the boy jumps out of his bedroom window and dies in the process.As the authorities press upon Lammark to find the shooter, he invites Eleanor home and introduces her to his husband... revealing himself to be a closeted homosexual. Lammark also confronts Eleanor about her FBI rejection, citing psychiatric issues such as depression as the reason. She confesses that she took up a job in the police force to save her from her own self-destructive tendencies.A few days later, another horrific incident takes place. In a shopping mall, a man is seen stealing the clothes of a guy from the male changing room and washing it clean in the sink area of the toilet. Another man spots him in the act and informs the mall security guards about this unaccepted behavior, who try to trace the stranger down. When they finally find him, he is stealing food at the food court. As the guards tried to ask him to leave, the man pulls out a gun and shoots the people around him dead. He escapes from the rest of the police, who are after him, by blowing them up with grenades planted in a nearby dustbin. Lammark and Eleanor reach the place shortly afterward and are horrified by the nonchalance of the man.The news spreads like wildfire. The FBI takes down a group of local NRA members who support gun violence in another attempt at finding the perpetrator. In the course of the investigation, Lammark and Eleanor come to believe that the shooter has access to old guns and military equipment, and the lab stool result shows that the man was on a plant-based diet in the days following up to New Year's Eve. However, the authorities at this point have lost confidence in Lammark and his team after the second attempt at crackdown and both Lammark and Eleanore are removed from investigating the case any further. Subsequently, a realization strikes Eleanor, which finally leads her to the culprit. A man named Dean Possey (Ralph Ineson).Throughout the whole movie, the detectives at work come to identify the primary traits of this man - a white guy, not a meat eater, and someone with access to old military weapons. Luckily, one of the men who painted the apartment that originally blew up provides a facial sketch of Possey and directs them to search at a meat processing factory around where he was previously employed.Eleanor and Lammark find out about Dean from the older employees at a slaughterhouse and learn that Dean is believed to have killed one of his superiors, who was also a bully to him. This led to his imprisonment for two years before he was released on parole in December 1999. Possey's father, Sergeant Arthur Possey, was the shooting instructor of the 75th Rangers, and Dean's parole had been supported by letters written by two of his father's army friends. Eleanor and Lammark try to dig deeper into his past only to understand that he has no credit cards in his name, no home address, and no social security number, rendering him the qualities of a ghost in today's world.After arriving at Mrs. Possey's house, she briefs him about how Dean was injured in the head by two bullets during his childhood and how he started despising the world around him as he grew up and became extremely introverted, so much that he was overjoyed when everyone was locked up at home during the COVID pandemic of 2020-2021.Eleanor spots two cups of tea and a flannel shirt hanging from the clothes stand, ultimately realizing that Dean Possey may be hiding in the outhouse. While they can't contact the force by any means, someone from the neighborhood possibly reports to the police about gunshots - one that Dean uses to kill Lammark and another that Mrs. Possey shoots herself in the head. Dean then emerges from the outhouse and confronts Eleanor, but does not shoot her.When conversing with Eleanor, Dean Possey confesses that it made sense to him to shoot 200+ people because human beings made a lot of noise, appreciating fireworks display year after year. Dean wishes for there to be fewer lights so that one can see the stars. He appeared to be generally angry at the world, at the capitalist and cruel systems that prevail in society, from working 12-hour shifts to be recognized in the country to killing cows for making burger patties.Moreover, Dean feels observed at all times, constantly needing to be recognized or earn money to survive in the world. He doesn't seem to have any remorse when he says that if he couldn't find peace in the world, he could at least deliver retribution. Dean also denied feeling like 'love' could save him because he had already traversed too far down the road of unhappiness and crimes. It is likely that Dean Possey is suffering from a chronic mental illness which led him to commit these crimes in cold blood.Dean injures Eleanor in the head and holds her captive in the outhouse as he prepares to take down the police, killing the first two and blowing up several officers when they tried to move closer to the outhouse. Eleanor initially tries to rationalize with him, failing at which she bites Dean in the throat and tears some of the flesh, injuring him. Dean walks away into the night with his guns. Eleanor desperately frees herself and instructs the police about Dean's whereabouts. They finally spot Dean and kill him in a hail of bullets.The FBI negotiates with Eleanor to keep quiet about Dean Possey's death in a police encounter as not to bring about negative publicity to the department over them killing a suspect instead of taking him into custody for trial. Eleanor is made a special agent at the FBI, and they also agree to honor Lammark's contributions with a medal of valor and direct all his pensions to his husband. The movie ends with a shot of Eleanor walking down the streets of the busy city.",

        "synopsis": "Venice, Italy, 1947Belgian private detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) awakens from a nightmare. He has retired from detective work and currently lives in post-World War 2 Venice, but people continue to hound him for help in solving mysteries due to his past reputation (as referenced in the previous films 'Murder on the Orient Express' and 'Death on the Nile'). Poirot is now accompanied by a bodyguard, former police officer Vitale Portfoglio (Riccardo Scarmacio), who keeps the people from pestering him.One day, Poirot is visited by an old friend, named Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey). She is an author whose last few books have not seen much success. Ariadne invites Poirot to attend a Halloween party at a palazzo belonging to former opera singer Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly). The main event will be a seance performed by renowned medium Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh), described in the press as \"The Unholy Mrs. Reynolds\".Poirot and Vitale accompany Ariadne across the canal as they arrive at the palazzo. A group of children are there, being told a story about how the palazzo used to be an orphanage, but the doctors and nurses abandoned the children to die there during the Plague, leading to the belief that the spirits of the children haunt the palazzo. There is said to be a curse, the Children's Vendetta, and any victim is marked with a slash on them as a sign. One of the children, Leopold (Jude Hill), is taken care of by the housemaid, Olga Seminoff (Camille Cottin), as he does not join the other children and prefers to read a Poe book. Leopold goes to see his nervous father, Dr. Leslie Ferrier (Jamie Dornan). Poirot and Ariadne see Rowena, and Ariadne notes that the previous year, Rowena lost her daughter Alicia (Rowan Robinson) in what is believed to be a suicide after she fell from the balcony. Because of this, Rowena has had trouble selling the palazzo. Olga and Dr. Ferrier also feel a sense of loss since they knew and cared for Alicia as well.Joyce arrives to the palazzo, accompanied by her assistant Desdemona Holland (Emma Laird). Arriving seemingly uninvited is Alicia's ex-fiance Maxime Gerard (Kyle Allen). Rowena and Ferrier clearly don't like him but he claims someone else invited him.The seance begins with everyone gathered in a circle, and Joyce sitting in the middle. Olga tells Poirot that before her death, Alicia had begun to see hallucinations of the dead children. Joyce appears to be channeling Alicia's spirit, with any indication of her communication coming from keys seemingly being pressed on a typewriter. Poirot cuts the charade by revealing a second assistant in the chimney, Desdemona's half brother Nicholas (Ali Khan), who was flipping a switch to make the typewriter keys press automatically. Then, Joyce begins to spin around and make horrific noises and motions, before talking to Rowena with what sounds like Alicia's voice, which frightens some of the guests.Poirot attempts to leave, despite Ariadne's protests. He then talks to Joyce, who says that it would be easier and less painful for her if she was a fraud, but she knows that Poirot has seen enough death to understand her. She puts her mask on him along with her robe and encourages him to lighten up. Poirot then goes by the pot where the children were bobbing for apples, and he attempts to do so himself, only for an unseen figure to push his head into the water in an attempt to drown him, but the culprit flees before Poirot loses consciousness. He is found by Vitale, and they then hear a scream. Outside, Joyce's body falls and is impaled on a statue's hand.A storm begins outside, flooding the canals and ensuring that nobody can leave the palazzo. The guests begin to panic and grow paranoid, believing that there might be a supernatural force that killed Joyce. Poirot locks everyone inside and begins to suspect that one of them murdered her. Poirot brings Ariadne with him to begin to interview the suspects. They find a stuffed rabbit called Baba that belonged to Alicia, which had previously been missing.Poirot and Ariadne begin by speaking to Olga, then Dr. Ferrier, who suffers from PTSD and is haunted by his time at the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp due to his guilt over not being able to save the victims of that time. He says that him taking on Alicia was a favor to Rowena because he was in love with Rowena.Poirot excuses himself to go to the bathroom, where he believes he sees Alicia's ghost in the mirror behind him. He finds Leopold outside, who tells him he is jumpy like Dr. Ferrier, and the boy claims to hear the voices of the ghost children.Poirot and Ariadne then interview Nicholas and Desdemona separately to get unbiased accounts. They give their accounts of the evening, as well as their history being Romani refugees trying to make it to America. Poirot also learns that the siblings stole from Joyce and were possibly threatened by her. Desdemona attempts to make a run for it after punching Vitale, but Olga trips her and knocks her down.The phone in the foyer begins to ring, but when Poirot and Vitale answer, there is nobody on the other end. Poirot then appears to see one of the ghost children, until Ariadne calls him and he finds nobody after turning his head back. He also thinks he hears the sound of a child singing, which Leopold also claims to hear. Poirot thinks it is coming from the basement, but Rowena says there is no basement in the house.The group moves downstairs and finds a hidden room, with the word \"dottore\" (Italian for 'doctor') written on the wall, further alluding to the Children's Vendetta. Dr. Ferrier begins to have a panic attack, and when Maxime tells him to keep it together, they get into a fight until Ferrier almost kills Maxime before Leopold calms him down. Ferrier goes to lie down in the music room and is locked inside, with Poirot having the only key. Poirot and Ariadne then speak to Maxime, who has a half of a ripped picture of Alicia. He claims he had to break off his engagement to her because Rowena did not approve of him, and Alicia seemed desperate to keep her mother happy.Poirot inspects the invitation that Maxime received, decoding the word \"apple\" from it. When Ariadne showed up at his home, she brought an apple with her. Poirot confronts her and Vitale, saying he has figured out that they conspired with Joyce to bring him to the palazzo. Vitale was the officer that pulled Alicia out of the canal and investigated her death, so he knew the ins and outs of the palazzo, while Ariadne was hoping to use the seance and Poirot's inability to solve it as the basis for her new story. Ariadne admits to him that she needed a good new story after a string of flops. Desdemona then bursts in and tells Poirot to hurry with the key.The group finds Ferrier dead with a knife in his back. Leopold is devastated at the sight. After the group disperses, Olga talks to Poirot and says that Rowena was always by Alicia's side before her death, but prior to it, Olga heard voices coming from her room. Poirot then looks at photos of Alicia and notices one of her as a little girl, the same little girl he thought he saw in the house earlier. He also notices a specific type of flower in one of the pictures. In another brief state of delusion, Poirot turns around as the house's pet parrot knocks over a teacup. Poirot goes to clean it up and then finds the other half of Maxime's picture, which is of himself and Alicia.Poirot then gathers the guests together, as he has solved the mystery. The killer is none other than Rowena herself. Poirot explains that Rowena had planted rhododendrons in her garden and extracted a honey from it that she used to drug Alicia, keeping her under care against her will following her returning after breaking things off with Maxime. The honey also caused hallucinations, which made Alicia believe that she saw the ghost children, and it is the same honey that Poirot earlier consumed with tea and made him see ghosts too. When Alicia was having a psychotic break, Olga administered more honey because she believed it was calming to her, but she accidentally gave her a fatal overdose. Rowena threw Alicia's body into the canal and staged it as a suicide. The revelation causes Olga to feel extreme guilt. Rowena later learned she was being blackmailed and suspected either Joyce or Ferrier. She was the one who attempted to drown Poirot, believing it was Joyce since he was wearing her mask and robe. When she did find Joyce, she pushed her off the balcony to her death, and she used a hand rake to mark her back with the so-called Children's Vendetta, as she did with Alicia. But since Rowena was nowhere near Ferrier when he died, Poirot explains this as her finding out that he blackmailed her, and she threatened Leopold's life unless he did what she said, so Ferrier walked backwards into a knife to spare his son. Poirot figures that Rowena was hoping that blaming the deaths on ghosts would get her off easy.Rowena begins to make a run for it. Poirot pursues her to the balcony, where she aims a weapon at him. A flash of thunder strikes, and Poirot sees what looks like Alicia's ghost appear behind Rowena. The ghost then seems to pull Rowena down, sending her plunging into the canal to her death.In the morning, the canal clears up, and the guests begin to leave. Poirot and Ariadne have one last conversation before parting ways, apparently forever. Olga adopts Leopold, and Poirot learns that he was the blackmailer after deducing that Rowena was making a poison. He had also been trying to support his father by using the money Rowena sent from the blackmail.Poirot returns to his home, having his faith somewhat restored. A man that earlier approached him comes into his home, hoping for Poirot to solve the deaths of his parents and brother. Poirot already deduced from minor facts that the family doctor was involved in the hopes of earning their inheritance, and the great detective jumps on the case.",

        "synopsis": "Kevin, a four year old boy, is playing on the stairs of his home in the mid 1990's. Suddenly, he is shoved down the stairs for an unknown reason. He is noticeably injured, but his father is relived that he does not need stitches. His father assumes he fell.An unknown amount of time later, but suggested that maybe later that night or the next, Kevin wakes up in the middle of the night by a loud noise. He wakes up his sister, Kaylee, a similarly aged young girl. They turn on the lights of their respective upstairs bedrooms and walk into the hallway to investigate. After a few moments of investigating the upstairs floor, they call out for their father, who does not respond. They shrug off this issue, assuming their father will be back soon.Excited by the prospect of their father not being home, Kaylee suggests sleeping downstairs in the living room. Downstairs, they set up their bedspreads on the couches of the living room and build a Lego village on the floor in front of the TV. They TV plays old VHS cartoons, especially properties such as Betty Boop and Disney-like animation accompanied by classic cartoon soundtracks, which play throughout the entire film. After playing for a while, they decide to investigate the rest of the house, which is seemingly operating with limited power. They discover that night lights have been unplugged, phone lines have been disconnected, and all the windows and doors of the home have disappeared.Later that night Kaylee asks Kevin where their parents could be, however Kevin is noticeably uncomfortable by the mention of their mother, and asks that Kaylee does not bring her up again. Later they continue playing with Lego's and hear a sudden loud noise coming from the adjoining dining room. Now possessing a flashlight, they investigate to find a chair now standing upside down on the ceiling. They are clearly disturbed, but shrug it off before returning to their leisure in the living room before falling asleep.After waking up, Kaylee calls Kevin into the downstairs bathroom, pointing out that the toilet has now disappeared. They collect two buckets as a remedy, but not before stating how gross this is. Later that day or night (they have completely lost track of time), Kaylee hears a voice coming from the dark hallway next to the living room, which beckons her to go upstairs. She follows, which leads her to her parents' bedroom. The voice whispers to look under the bed, where she sees nothing, but when she looks up she finds a female figure sitting on the bed, which she assumes is her mother. The \"mother\" asks Kaylee to close her eyes, which she obeys, when she opens them she finds that the figure is gone, just before the room erupts in a sharp, high frequency noise and blinding light before immediately falling dark again.An indefinite amount of time later, Kaylee has joined her brother in the living room again. Kevin asks what happened upstairs, but Kaylee does not respond. However, Kaylee insists on moving one of the couches to block entry/exit into the dark adjoining hallway where the voice originated. Later that night, while the two sleep, the cartoon on the TV begins to repeat a scene where a character preforms an illusion where they make themselves disappear. While doing so, the stuffed dolls of both children begin to disappear.The next day/night the voice returns, asking that both children go downstairs to the basement. Kevin, still adorning the flashlight lead his sister into the basement. Soon after, the flashlight loses power. The two young children immediately start to lose composure and get lost in the darkness. Kevin calls out to Kaylee, with no answer. Suddenly the flashlight regains power, only to immediately shine on Kaylee's face, which has now lost both their eyes and mouth and are instead covered by skin.Kevin is now alone in the living room. While he tries to survive, more and more items begin to shift towards the ceiling and other walls in the house. Kevin does not seem to care. The voice comes from the hallway again, but this time commanding that Kevin retrieves a knife from the kitchen, and stab his eye out. The camera then cuts to different rooms around the house while a child's scream erupts, seemingly no less terrifying and loud depending on the room or floor.Now in horrible, severe pain, Kevin attempts to use the phone again, and is surprised to see that it works. He calls 911, where an operator on the other line asks questions about his location and condition, and that Kevin stays on the line until other \"grown ups\" can come and help. Kevin responds, saying that he \"is cut and feeling sick\". The operator asks for his location, where Kevin responds that \"The doors are gone\" before dropping the home phone on the floor and leaving the room.Later, Kevin calls out to the voice, asking what happened to Kaylee. The voice responds, saying that Kaylee did not do as she was told therefore, her mouth was \"removed\". Soon after, the voice whispers that Kevin needs to come upstairs. He obeys, and soon starts to lose power with his flashlight. To remedy this situation, he turns the flashlight on and off sporadically to save battery. After multiple instances of turning the flashlight on and off, he finds himself standing on the ceiling of the second floor of the house. He calls out for Kaylee and his mother, before being pulled around a corner by an unknown being. From the corner, blood sprays and pours out while Kevin calls out for his \"mommy\". The shot plays then reverses again multiple times. A door is shown in the pitch darkness, but does not open.Later, Kevin's toy radio is seen suspended and sitting upright of the upstairs hallway ceiling, defying gravity. This is surrounded by his other Lego's and bulling toys. The radio plays the cartoon theme music from earlier. It is revealed that it has been roughly a year and a half since the previous events. The camera fades out, showing that the hallway its infinite and continues until the radio and Lego stack are out of sight.Kevin, who is revealed to have survive the previous events, has gained control of his flashlight again. In the darkness, he makes out a face that stares at him with an absent expression. He calls out to it, asking for its name, to no response. He asks again, but the figure does not respond instead electing to stare at him in the darkness.THE END.",

        "synopsis": "Brynn is a seamstress still living in her childhood home who mourns the loss of her mother and best friend, Maude. She copes with these losses by constructing a model town in her living room. A past event appears to have turned the entire town against Brynn, so she leads an anxious, solitary and withdrawn life. One night she awakens to discover an intruder in her home and quickly realizes the intruder is a humanoid alien. Brynn attempts to escape but is stalked by the intruder. When the alien uses telekinesis to subdue her, Brynn accidentally stabs it in the head with the broken fragment of her model town's school bell tower, causing it to release Brynn.Brynn discovers all electronic devices were rendered useless after the alien's intrusion. She abandons her car and the alien's body before heading into town. She passes her neighbor's ransacked house and an overturned mail van as she makes her way to the police station. At the station, Brynn unexpectedly encounters Maude's parents, who happen to be the chief of police and his wife. Maude's mother looks at Brynn with contempt, spits in her face, and walks out of the station. Brynn decides to flee, but as she rides a bus leaving town, several passengers attempt to restrain her, all of whom are possessed by other aliens, and chase her. She comes across a deserted church and visits Maude's grave, only to spot a group of people who appear to be under the influence of small tentacled creatures that slither visibly beneath the skin of their throats. At Brynn's home that evening, a glowing light carries the alien's corpse out of her house and Brynn is forced to fend off two more creatures. After an intermittent fight with a smaller alien, Brynn impales it through a wardrobe with a broken mop handle and slams the wardrobe door on its head.Brynn flees her home but is caught and dragged by an alien-controlled man to a flying saucer's tractor beam. However, just as she is about to be raised into the craft, she kicks the man into the tractor beam and runs away. The third and much larger alien stalks and attacks Brynn, eventually climbing over her house to catch her. She leads it into her station wagon, where its long limbs become trapped in the unfamiliar cabin. One of its feet punctures the gas tank, which Brynn ignites. A flying saucer extinguishes the flames with a ray but the creature is burned to death.After running back into her home, a humanoid alien telekinetically throws her through a wall and she is restrained with a red ray. The alien levitates and regurgitates a tentacled creature, which forcibly enters Brynn's mouth. Brynn immediately falls into an intense hallucination in which her home is undamaged and her best friend, Maude, is still alive, but she breaks free of her hallucination and tears the tentacled creature from her mouth. The alien summons a flying saucer and it levitates the tentacled creature and causes it rapidly to grow a body double of Brynn. The Brynn-double chases the real Brynn into the woods.The Brynn-double catches Brynn and stabs her, but she kills it with a boxcutter and escapes to a deserted road. There she encounters a huge alien before being sucked into a flying saucer. Inside, Brynn is mentally pushed into memories by a group of humanoid aliens, forcing her to remember the event that turned her entire town against her. During an argument in a field, Brynn is knocked to the ground by Maude, and she strikes Maude in the head with the stone, killing her. The aliens converse with one another and return Brynn to Earth without a tentacled organism controlling her actions.Sometime later, Brynn lives in her undamaged home. Every other resident of her town is now evidently under control of the aliens and yet, in a stark reversal of Brynn's life before the invasion, the townspeople are quite neighborly with her.",

        "synopsis": "A professional assassin (Michael Fassbender) stakes out a Parisian hotel room. He prepares to use a sniper rifle to kill a target who will check into the hotel room at an unspecified time. While waiting for the target, he eats, practices yoga, listens to The Smiths, and talks on the phone with his handler, an attorney, and his former university law professor, Edward \"Eddie\" Hodges (Charles Parnell). The assassin has been waiting for 5 days for the target to arrive, and wants to leave, but Hodge insists that they don't get paid, unless the job is carried out.\nThe assassin is shown to be patient and methodical. He builds redundancies into his plans. He likes to observe the cities in which he operates and observes the people in these cities and their daily routines. His identity while he is on the road is of a German tourist.\nBut for 5 nights, the assassin has been waking up every hour to check if the target has arrived. He is sleep deprived and weary. Then on the 6th night, there is action in the middle of the night.The target arrives with a dominatrix and the Killer misses his target, accidentally shooting the dominatrix (Monique Ganderton). He flees on an e-scooter, evading the police and disposing of his rifle and gear. He then flies to the United States under fake identities such as Felix Unger, Archibald Bunker.\nThe killer informs Hodges about his failure. The window of opportunity to take out the target is closed now for a long period of time.The Killer returns to his home and hideout in the Dominican Republic to find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala (Sophie Charlotte) has been attacked. He finds boot prints all around the hideout to indicate that the attackers staked the house for a while before making their move.\nShe is in an intensive care unit of a hospital, with her brother Marcus (Emiliano Pern\u00eda) watching over her. He says that Magdala was interrogated and tortured by two assassins (one of which was a woman) but managed to injure one of them and escape. The killers were not interested in disguising themselves. Marcus says that after they were done, Magdala saw them leave in a car with a green top, like a taxi.\nThe Killer tracks down the taxi driver (there is only one company that runs a green color taxi in Dominican Republic), Leo (Gabriel Polanco), who drove the assassins to the Killer's home. Leo identifies one of the assassins, a strong man with an injured leg; \"The Brute\" (Sala Baker), and a woman who \"resembled a Q-Tip\" (Tilda Swinton). Leo picked them up from a private airport, drove them according to their instructions, waited for them an hour at the Killer's property and then drove them back to the airport.\nThe Killer kills Leo, and he breaks his \"Fight only the battle you're paid to fight\" rule and seeks to track down the two assassins.The Killer travels to Hodges' office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and enters the building disguised as a custodial worker. It is revealed that Hodges used to teach law to the Killer, but then encouraged to venture out into contract killing.\nAfter forcing Dolores (Kerry O'Malley), Hodges' secretary, to restrain her boss and herself, the Killer destroys the records of their work. Hodges says that he had to make retributions to a very angry and powerful man, and he never thought that the Killer would return home.\nAs Hodges attempts to get the Killer to leave, the Killer shoots him in the chest with a nail gun to torture the names of the hit-men out of him.\nHowever, Hodges doesn't reveal the names and dies quicker than the Killer anticipated. Dolores offers to show the Killer the assassins' identities in her paper files in her home, asking in return that the Killer give her a non-suspicious death so her children can claim a life insurance payout. After receiving the names of the 2 assassins and the client who paid Hodges, at her home, the Killer breaks his rule not to show empathy; he snaps her neck and shoves her down a flight of stairs, making the fall look like an accident. He later disposes of Hodges' body on a ship.Afterward, the Killer drives to St. Petersburg, Florida, identifying the Brute by his limp. The Killer tracks the Brute through the day as he travels to a casino with his friends and returns late at night.\nAfter drugging his pit bull, the Killer enters his house to kill him, only to be blindsided and tackled. They engage in a fight, and the Brute recognizes the Killer. The Killer shoots him and runs from his reawakened dog, burning down his home with a Molotov cocktail.The Killer travels to Beacon, New York. He tracks the 2nd assassin from her home as she leaves in her car and confronts The expert \"Q-Tip\" assassin in a gourmet restaurant. Appearing to accept her fate, the Expert questions the Killer's motivations in continuing and lessening competency in his profession, as they partake in her \"last supper\" of whiskey. The Expert tries to argue that it was an address and a target and nothing personal and that she had nothing to do with what Brute did to Magdala.\nIn a park outside, the Expert appears to trip on the stairs and requests the Killer to give her a hand. The Killer, instead, kills her and notices she had a concealed knife in her hand.The Killer travels to Chicago, where the client (Arliss Howard), billionaire venture capitalist Henderson \"Clay\" Claybourne, lives in an upscale penthouse. The Killer transfers all of his finances to the Dominican Republic under the name Jefferson and observes Claybourne's routine. The Killer then uses tools purchased online to clone Claybourne's key-card and enter his penthouse.\nThe Killer confronts Claybourne at gunpoint in his penthouse, asking him why he ordered the retaliatory hit. Claybourne claims that he has no personal problem with him. After the miss in Paris, Claybourne claims that Hodges called him and informed him of the miss. Claybourne was OK as mistakes do happen, and it was Hodges who sold him on the idea of a cleanup to prevent any blow-back from his target.\nAs a first-time client of a hit-man, agreed to pay Hodges for \"the trail to be scrubbed\" for an additional $150,000.\nThe Killer spares Claybourne, though promising him a \"slow death\" if Claybourne ever comes for him. Later, The Killer returns to the Dominican Republic and sits next to a recovering Magdala.",

        "synopsis": "Taking place on October 16, 2023, when Walt Disney Animation Studios turned 100 years old, its employees are leaving the building as their usual work day is done and Burny Mattinson imagines about the walls of the studio after talking with an intern.Inside the studio, Mickey Mouse, as seen in a production cel for Mickey's Birthday Party, comes to life, and calls Tinker Bell. Mickey questions if all of the employees are gone, in which Tink nods with a yes. Excited, Mickey, with his girlfriend Minnie, jump out of the cel, and Minnie gets many characters from the studio's filmography with a \"Yoo-Hoo\" signal, traditionally or computer animated while enlisting Peter Pan to gather everyone from upstairs. Mickey reminds every character from the studio to take a group photo, all meeting in the lobby.During that, several gags of the characters interacting do happen such as:Sisu running happily down the hall, followed by Jim Hawkins riding on his Alponian Solar Cruiser, Maui flying in his hawk form, Aladdin and Abu sliding down the railing with them ending up with the trolls, Vanellope von Schweetz and Dodger riding on her candy kart, Elliott taking Cody on a fun ride, and Wayne and Lanny sliding down their ropes.\nMoana searching for water for Flounder, and with help from Merlin (who was at the Snuggly Duckling coffee area with his sugar bowl, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, and Dr. Krunklehorn), he uses his magic to summon water in the Mad Hatter's hat for Flounder to swim in.\nElsa freezing Hans from his frame after Anna ask her if she thinks that all of the villains will be show up (most likely because she would be worried about seeing Hans again after he tried to kill them) after seeing an angry Stromboli trying to get a candy from the studio's snack machine.\nFlash taking his time walking to the elevator, much to the chagrin of Donald Duck, Humphrey, Ranger Woodlore, Terk, Carl, and Mother Gothel, with Baymax squeezing in the elevator after he makes it.\nOlaf drawing on a desk as the Robin Williams Lost Boy, Timon and Pumbaa walk by, with Timon telling him to shake a leg (in which Olaf replies that the leg won't make a difference) when Genie bursts out of the drawing, sending Olaf into pieces and he uses his magic to put Olaf back together.\nWhile Prince John, Thomas O'Malley, Chicken Little, Milo Thatch, Happy, the Headless Horseman, and Gaston are freshening up in the men's room, the Cheshire Cat appears in front of his face, laughing, when Minnie comes in while covering her eyes and tells them to move it.\nWhile Christopher Robin, Kanga, and Eeyore try to free Winnie the Pooh from his picture, Antonio Madrigal is seen speaking to Cinderella's bird friends, Meeko, Cri-kee, Pascal, and Pua while stopping Joanna the Goanna from eating Jaq and Gus before getting spooked by a barking Pluto.\nWhile MacBadger, Ratty, Mole, Ryder, Honeymaren, Sven, and Kristoff walk by, Kristoff warns some Dalmatian puppies, who are watching \"Night on Bald Mountain\" on a TV, that it'll give them nightmares when Chernabog pops out of the TV, scaring the puppies and they run away, while running over Scrooge McDuck, who drops his sacks of money, and Robin Hood and Little John grab them.\nUrsula was being followed and annoyed by a love struck Splat. Cinderella and Prince Charming follow down the stairs, where the prince is the one to drop his shoe, much to their humor. Max picks up the shoe and runs off with it. Charming calls for Eric while Cinderella cheers for Max. Mickey was amused by this when he sees Kaa leading Clarabelle Cow with his hypnosis. He tries to get him to stop, but Rapunzel has it covered, hitting Kaa with her frying pan off-screen.While all of this is happening, Mickey looks up at a photograph of studio co-founder Walt Disney and takes his hat off to fondly remember his legacy. Minnie reminds Mickey that everyone is at the lobby as Mickey speaks to the picture saying that he has to go.Everyone then ventures outside to take the group photo. However, things backfire as Goofy accidentally falls off the ladder, breaking the camera. Everyone prepares to leave in disappointment as the group photo is cancelled. Just then, Alan-a-Dale plays \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" on his lute joined in by Scat Cat on his trumpet and Mirabel Madrigal on her accordion.As everyone sings the song, Lewis Robinson cries, the brooms sweep up Goofy's camera, Fix-It Felix Jr. fixes it with his hammer, Hercules puts the ladder back in position, and the Fairy Godmother uses her magic wand to help Goofy up the ladder while setting the camera up for the photo. Everyone is prepared as the song comes to a close.The photo is taken, and Tinker Bell then cuts the scene to the group photo and the film ends with a tagline \"To all who imagined with us, laughed with us and dreamed with us, thank you\".",
        "plot": "An all-star ensemble of beloved characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios come together for a joyful, entertaining and emotional reunion as they assemble for a spectacular group photo to mark Disney's 100th anniversary."

        "synopsis": "Anlaf, a Viking king from Ireland, arrives with his army in Northumbria after learning that Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons, has fallen gravely ill. Edward soon dies, leaving behind three sons, none of whom were named as his aetheling. Lady Eadgifu and the youngest son Edmund flee to Bebbanburg where Edward's former ally Uhtred resides. Although retired from war, Uhtred is informed that Edward's eldest son Aethelstan will likely attack his younger brother Aelfweard and makes plans to stop him. Before Uhtred leaves, Ingrith prophesies that \"seven kings must die\" before England is to be united. Uhtred reaches Aegelesburg, where Aelfweard prepares to defend against Aethelstan's impending attack. Aethelstan and his advisor Ingilmundr soon arrive and thwart a trap set by Aelfweard. Uhtred convinces Aelfweard to surrender peacefully, but Aethelstan swiftly kills him and massacres his men. Aethelstan is crowned king of the Saxons and Ingilmundr, who is secretly Aethelstan's lover, urges him to fulfill his grandfather's dream of uniting England and all Christians. In Eoferwic, Aethelstan has taken over following the death of the previous Northumbrian king Rognvaldr and demands that all foreign kings pay him tribute or face conquest and forced baptism. Uhtred arrives and witnesses the destruction of Pagan monuments before learning that King Hywel Dda has submitted to Aethelstan after his son is taken hostage. Uhtred then discovers Aethelstan's relationship with Ingilmundr and believes he's being deceived. Ingilmundr secretly plans to have Uhtred killed, but he's warned by Aldhelm and flees back to Bebbanburg. Aldhelm is subsequently labeled a traitor by Aethelstan and hanged for his actions. Ingilmundr arrives at Bebbanburg to take the castle, but unaware that Uhtred had escaped, he's quickly captured. Ingilmundr later convinces a servant to lure Uhtred into a trap, where he is captured by Aethelstan's men, forcing Osbert to surrender Bebbanburg. Osbert and Edmund are taken captive and sent to Thelwael while Aethelstan, unable to kill Uhtred, banishes him from England. On the Isle of Man, Anlaf hosts a gathering of kings with Prince Domnal and the rulers of Strathclyde, Orkney, Shetland, and Man, warning them of Aethelstan's impending conquest. Although they initially decline the offer of allying with a Pagan, Aethelstan embarks upon an invasion of Scotland, forcing King Constantin and the other rulers to form an alliance. A weakened Uhtred is found by the Danes and taken to Shetland, where he learns that Ingilmundr is a Danish spy and meets with Anlaf and the other kings who request that Uhtred assassinate Aethelstan to avoid war. Uhtred travels to Wintanceaster and unsuccessfully convinces Aethelstan to stop his conquest. Uhtred then returns to Bebbanburg, only to learn from Eadgifu that Anlaf had sacked the castle, and sealed Ingrith and the common-folk in a cave to suffocate. Ingilmundr massacres the Saxons at Thelwael, and Uhtred later arrives to discover that Osbert and Edmund had managed to stay hidden and survive. A remorseful Aethelstan makes peace with Uhtred and plans to stop Anlaf's invasion but refuses any help. Knowing that Aethelstan will likely die, Uhtred and his allies head to face Anlaf, who has amassed his forces at Brunanburh. At the Battle of Brunanburh, Uhtred and Aethelstan's forces are heavily outnumbered and make a tactical withdrawal allowing Saxon cavalry to flank from behind and in the chaos, Domnal and the heirs of the other kings are killed. After witnessing Ingilmundr attack Aethelstan, Uhtred is gravely wounded whilst attempting to aid him. In the aftermath of the battle, the other kings quickly abandon Anlaf and captive Ingilmundr is executed. Aethelstan helps return a mortally wounded Uhtred to Bebbanburg and Finan concludes that the deaths of Edward and the five heirs - five kings who will never be crowned - only partially fulfill the prophecy that \"seven kings must die\", while Uhtred speculates that he will be the seventh. Uhtred agrees to swear Northumbria to Aethelstan in exchange for him agreeing to make Edmund his sole heir, making Aethelstan the first king of a united England, fulfilling the dream of his grandfather King Alfred. Seemingly on the verge of death, Uhtred experiences a vision of Valhalla where he sees several of his deceased allies waiting for him.",
        "plot": "In the wake of King Edward's death, Uhtred of Bebbanburg and his comrades adventure across a fractured kingdom in the hopes of uniting England at last."

        "synopsis": "In the early 20th century, Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula met English lawyer R. M. Renfield, who was hoping to broker a deal for some land but ended up becoming Dracula's familiar.For decades, Renfield has relied on supernatural powers that are initiated by eating bugs. Dracula has recently had a close call with some vampire hunters who almost killed him, so the duo move to New Orleans to recuperate. There, Renfield discovers a 12-step self-help group for persons in co-dependent relationships, and he plans to use the crowd there to hunt out abusive lovers whom he can kill and give to Dracula to feast on without feeling remorse. He follows a narcissistic boyfriend to a warehouse with stolen drugs, and as he batters some lower-level criminals, they are all attacked by an assassin hired by the Lobo crime family who are pushing drugs into the city.Renfield kills the assassin and attempts to hunt down the man who hired him, Teddy Lobo, but Teddy drives off in a hurry, and a weakened Renfield drags the corpses back to Dracula's lair in the basement of a dilapidated hospital. Lobo runs into a sobriety checkpoint that is run by Rebecca Quincy, a second-generation police officer who sees the opportunity to take a high-level criminal off the streets and arrests Teddy after he speeds through the checkpoint and hurls bricks of cocaine at the police. At the police station, Teddy easily gets out of custody since the feds cooperate with the Lobos. Meanwhile, Quincy has a confrontation with her sister Kate, who has also dedicated herself to police work but is gathering a large-scale case with the FBI, frustrating Rebecca, who wants answers and justice immediately.Dracula tells Renfield that the criminals he has brought as food are insufficient, and the vampire desires the blood of someone pure and innocent instead. Renfield goes to a restaurant to abduct commoners while Quincy is also led there with clues at the crime scene. The two are caught in an attack on Quincy's life that Teddy has been pressured into making so that the fierce reputation of the Lobos will be reestablished. Instead, Renfield and Quincy defend themselves, killing several gang members and leading Teddy to escape.Teddy's mother, Bellafrancesca, orders him to hunt down the man who killed her foot soldiers, and he ends up encountering Dracula when Renfield is away. The two agree to form an alliance while Renfield has taken to heart the teachings of his self-help group and decides to make a life for himself apart from his master. Setting up an apartment and changing his attitude to one of helpfulness, he gives a statement to the police to help them try to finally stop the Lobo Crime Family. Dracula learns of Renfield's betrayal and slaughters the support group members in front of his former minion.Quincy appears and finds Renfield surrounded by dead bodies, causing her to arrest him until she is immediately swarmed by police officers and the Lobos, who also want revenge on Renfield. Quincy refuses to hand him over, and she barely escapes with Renfield. Quincy wakes up the next morning to find that Renfield has saved her life, and he explains his true origin while confirming that he wants to reform himself. The two fight through a group of corrupt police officers and decide to storm the Lobos headquarters, only to find that Dracula has empowered over a half-dozen gang members to have all of Renfield's supernatural abilities, including Teddy. After a fight, Renfield kills Teddy.Quincy heads to stop Dracula and finds that her sister is beaten to near-death and only the healing properties of Dracula's blood can save her, which he will offer in exchange for Rebecca's loyalty. She tricks Dracula, leading to him having a final standoff with Renfield and Quincy that ends with the two collaborating to capture him in a magical circle.Renfield and Quincy beat Dracula into pieces, capture loads of his healing blood, and divide up the bits of his corpse into pieces of concrete that they scatter across the water system, either finally destroying the vampire or at least making it very hard for him to reform his body. Renfield later resurrects his self-help group friends with him feeling empowered to make a new life for himself.",

Picked up while hitchhiking, Becky and her dog Diego eventually settle in with a matronly woman named Elena, who treats Becky like a responsible daughter and does not pry about her past.Anthony, DJ, and Sean, three members of an extremist group called the Noble Men, stop at the diner where Becky works as a waitress. Angered by their insulting misogyny, Becky purposefully dumps a hot cup of coffee in Anthony's lap, so the three men secretly follow Becky home. Despite claiming he only wanted to scare the girl, Anthony ends up shooting Elena in her head, knocking Becky unconscious, and kidnapping Diego upon breaking into the house. After Becky recovers, she vows to find her dog and take revenge on the men.Remembering that the men previously mentioned meeting with someone named Darryl, Becky finds two local addresses linked to that name. The first location leads Becky to an elderly woman identified as Darryl Sr. The second leads Becky to a remote cabin where Noble Men cell leader Darryl hosts a meeting with Anthony, DJ, Sean, and another militia member known as Twig. Becky sneaks into the cabin and finds evidence that a town hall protest planned for the next day will actually be an armed insurrection against Senator Hernandez. Becky also steals a secret thumb drive containing membership information on everyone associated with the Noble Men.Becky leaves a cellphone on Darryl's doorstep that she uses to taunt the men. Becky's arrival forces Anthony, DJ, and Sean to confess to kidnapping her dog, but they do not say anything to Darryl about having murdered Elena.Darryl makes Anthony go after Becky. Becky leads Anthony into a hidden pit in the forest. She then rigs Anthony with a grenade trap that blows up his head when Darryl reopens the front door.

        "synopsis": "In 1966 southern California, Richard Monta\u00f1ez grows up as a hard-working child with a strict father and supportive grandfather. He meets his future wife Judy in school where he begins selling burritos to other children. He is arrested at a young age when nobody believed that he made his money this way. As an adult, Richard and Judy live their lives as hoodlums selling drugs but turn their life around once Judy gets pregnant with their first child. A second child later, Richard and his family begin struggling trying to make ends meet as he searches for work. He eventually turns to his friend, and fellow former hoodlum, Tony Romero, who helps him get a job at Frito-Lay. Despite lying on his resum\u00e9, floor head Lonny Mason hires him. Richard begins paying attention to all the nuances of the factory and starts pursuing engineer maintenance leader Clarence C. Baker to help with teaching him about the machines. Despite some reluctance, Baker agrees and teaches Richard how to operate all the machinery in the factory. Unfortunately, the Reagan administration begins to severely affect low level paying jobs and Frito-Lay's stocks begin to go down. This eventually results in some of the workers getting laid off. Frito-Lay CEO Roger Enrico puts a video out to the workers which is viewed by Richard and gets the inspiration to \"think like a CEO\". After picking up his kids from school, Richard takes them out for elotes (Mexican street corn). Upon noticing that his youngest son Steven likes the spicy flavor, despite it bothering him, he realizes that the way to save Frito-Lay is to pitch to the Latino market. He convinces Baker and the rest of his coworkers to let him take some unflavored Cheetos home, but Judy offers that he talks to his father Vacho first about a job. Vacho ends up belittling Richard's plans, causing Judy to support Richard even more. The Monta\u00f1ezes work tirelessly trying to find the perfect spicy flavor for Cheetos, eventually getting the right concoction. Richard attempts to pitch his idea to Lonny, but he turns him down, forcing him to sneak in and copy Enrico's phone number. Richard manages to get through to Enrico who, while perplexed over being called by a janitor, is intrigued to learn that he saw his video and asks that he send his flavored Cheetos. He tastes them and is immediately hooked, setting up a meeting at the factory right away. While Lonny is upset with Richard, he prepares himself for the pitch, finally getting the approval of his father to back him up. Richard proceeds to speak from the heart and his pitch his accepted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos being put into production. While this results in more jobs, the new flavor is not flying off the shelves. Disappointed, Richard's children point out that there is no advertisements for the flavor. Richard returns to work and orders everyone to use their skills to sell the new flavor straight from the street. The tactic works and Enrico calls to ask that the factory produce an even bigger order. While Baker gets the promotion, he always desired, Richard is still a janitor, though Baker gives him some support. Lonny asks Richard to clean upstairs, only to find Enrico who tells him that he understands his struggles growing up, before revealing that he has been promoted to head of international marketing. Richard is applauded by all his coworkers for his success, and he happily calls Judy to tell her the good news. The end titles reveal that Richard retired from the company after 45 years and that he and Judy are still together.",
        "plot": "This is the inspiring true story of Richard Monta\u00f1ez who, as a Frito Lay janitor, disrupted the food industry by channeling his Mexican heritage to turn Flamin' Hot Cheetos from a snack into an iconic global pop culture phenomenon."

        "synopsis": "Beau Wassermann is the son of a famous and wealthy businesswoman, Mona. He grows up without a father, who his mother says died during an orgasm (which was also when Beau was conceived), a hereditary medical condition that she claims was passed down to Beau. As a teenager, Beau meets and falls in love with a girl named Elaine. The two kiss and Beau promises to remain a virgin until they meet again as adults.As an adult, Beau is extremely anxious and living alone in a crime-ridden city. His therapist prescribes an experimental drug for his anxiety and warns him to only take it with water. He prepares for a flight to see his mother for his parents' wedding anniversary. After being kept awake through the night due to a neighbor playing loud music through the walls, Beau sleeps through his alarm. After hastily packing, he discovers that his keys and luggage have been stolen from his door. Beau calls his mother to explain the situation, but she dismisses him.Beau takes his medication, but panics when he discovers there's a water outage. On his way to a convenience store across the street, he evades a group of deranged homeless people who break into his apartment and lock him out. After sleeping on scaffolding outside the building, Beau returns to his vandalized apartment the next morning. He attempts to call his mother, only to have it answered by a postal worker who describes finding a decapitated woman. Beau is soon told it is his mother. In a state of shock, he tries to take a bath and discovers an intruder hiding in the ceiling. The intruder falls and Beau runs naked out of his apartment and onto the streets. After a brief confrontation with a police officer, Beau is hit by a truck.Beau wakes up two days later in the house of a married couple, Grace and Roger. They care for an unstable veteran named Jeeves, who was their son's army comrade after he was killed in action. The couple have an angsty, teenage daughter named Toni who instantly despises Beau. Beau calls Mona's attorney, Dr. Cohen, who chastises him and informs Beau that her last wish was not to be buried until he is present. Roger promises to take Beau to his mother's estate as soon as possible, but insists he rest until he's healed. On the day Beau is supposed to leave, Toni takes Beau to her brother's old room and attempts to force him to paint the walls in different colors. When he refuses, she ruthlessly berates Beau and drinks out of a paint bucket, killing herself. Grace walks in on Beau standing over Toni's body and violently blames him for her death. Beau flees into the woods and Grace sends Jeeves after him.Lost in the wilderness, Beau comes upon a group of traveling theatre actors called \"The Orphans of the Forest\". He is invited to the rehearsal and becomes entranced by the play, imagining himself as the protagonist in a lengthy animated sequence that illustrates an alternate life path that parallels his own. A man approaches Beau and informs him that he knew his father and that he's alive. The troupe is ambushed by Jeeves, slaughtering several actors in the process. Beau evades Jeeves and flees deeper into the forest.Beau hitchhikes the rest of his way to the estate, only to find that he had just missed his mother's funeral. He naps on the couch and wakes up to the sound of a woman entering the house, late for the service. He realizes it is Elaine and they reconnect. They make their way to Mona's bedroom and passionately make love. Beau is terrified that he's going to die the second he ejaculates, but is relieved when he survives. However, Elaine has died mid-climax, her body frozen stiff. Mona then appears from the shadows and reveals that she was not only still alive but watching the whole time. She shames Beau and tells him that his therapist works for her and has been sharing their sessions with her for years. He demands to know the truth about his father and she takes him to the attic, where Beau learns that he not only has a secret twin brother, but his father is actually a giant penis-shaped monster. After further humiliation from his mother, an enraged Beau strangles her. He then leaves the estate and finds a motorboat on a beach, commandeering it into the sea and begins to drive it into a cave. The boat's motor begins to sputter and malfunction. It is revealed that he is inside a pool within a crowded arena. Beau is put on trial with Mona and Dr. Cohen acting as prosecutors while a defense attorney advocates for Beau. Video evidence of every time he has slighted his mother is broadcast on a jumbotron. Beau's attorney is murdered by one of Mona's henchmen, leaving Beau to fend for himself. Beau attempts to appeal to his mother one last time, but accepts his fate when she does not respond. The boat finally explodes, killing Beau. Mona and Dr. Cohen shake hands and leave the arena with the crowd.",

        "synopsis": "One night, a monkey (Dee Bradley Baker) is born from a stone atop a tall mountain and disturbs the Jade Emperor (Hoon Lee). Just as the Emperor gives the order to eliminate the cub, Buddha (BD Wong) appears before him and tells him to let him find his purpose.\nJade Emperor is the ruler of Heavens, while Buddha is the guiding light of the entire Universe.Monkey finds a troop of other monkeys, but his unruly nature keeps him from fitting in. One of his escapades causes a feared demon to pounce from his mountain lair and grab one of the troop's cubs for food; as a result, Monkey is banished. To prove his worth to the troop, he trains to fight the demon. After many years, when he deems himself ready, he confronts the demon, but his training proves ineffective, and another cub is snatched.\nTo fetch a more suitable weapon, Monkey dives into the sea realm of the Dragon King (Bowen Yang), where he finds the latter gloating over a glowing column which he means to use to eradicate all life on the world's surface. Communicating with the column, Monkey turns it into a staff and escapes.With the staff in hand, Monkey returns to the demon's lair, defeats him, and rescues the cub. Then he crowns himself King of the Monkeys (Jimmy O. Yang).\nThe troop's elder (James Sie) cautions that his staff should only be used by the gods. The new Monkey King decides to kill 100 demons, thus gaining the right to enter the Heavens and become a god. The Monkey King travels all over the world and kills 99 demons.\nEventually, he comes to a village terrorized by the Red Girl. With the endorsement of a girl named Lin (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), Monkey King defeats Red Girl, and Lin pledges herself as his assistant. But despite the 100 demons vanquished, the Immortal Ones do not descend from heaven to welcome the Monkey King to their realm.\nThe Dragon King emerges from the nearby sea during the victory celebration to reclaim his prized weapon. The Dragon King cannot stay outside of water very long. After fighting him and retaining the stick, Monkey King leaves the village; Lin tags along, even though he treats her condescendingly. Unknown to him, Lin is an agent of the Dragon King to help him reclaim the staff in return for saving her drought-stricken village.The stick tells The Monkey King that to become an Immortal, he needs immortality. The Monkey King needs Lin as he cannot read.The duo reaches a graveyard, where Monkey King opens a portal to Hell to get to the Archive of Souls and strike his name off his Scroll of Life and Death, thus gaining immortality. King Yama (Andrew Kishino), the ruler and chief judge of Hell, recognizes them as outsiders and fights them. With Lin's help, Monkey King succeeds in erasing his name, but is only made ageless.\nHe steals Yama's Book of Everlasting Life and learns that he must eat a peach from the Orchard of Everlasting Life to gain full immortality. The Dragon King subtly guides Monkey King and Lin to a peach tree laced with an intoxicating poison, but accidentally ends up eating one himself and running off.After realizing that the peaches are fake, Monkey King learns from the book that Wangmu (Jodi Long), the divine Queen Mother, brews an immortality elixir for the gods. He and Lin infiltrate the Jade Palace's pharmacy to create a sample of the elixir. Wangmu catches them in the act and attacks them, but Monkey King succeeds in consuming the potion, thus becoming fully immortal. Although Lin has several chances to steal the staff, she repeatedly returns to help Monkey King. Monkey King also demonstrates that despite his rude behavior, he cares about her too. Monkey King and Lin flee the Heavens, and in a following heart-to-heart, Lin admits that she longs to make a difference in the world and tries to encourage Monkey King to do the same.\nThe Monkey King refuses to part with his stick to help Lin with her village.When Monkey King remains aloof and boisterous, Lin outwits him and delivers the staff to the Dragon King. As soon as he has it, the Dragon King reneges on his deal and prepares to drown the world in a mega-storm, but Monkey King challenges and attacks him.\nRealizing her mistake, Lin tricks the Dragon King into blasting Monkey King with lightning, thus making him stronger and enabling him to beat the Dragon King.\nHowever, Monkey King becomes power-drunk and attacks the Heaven itself. Buddha prepares to intervene, but Lin wants to give Monkey King another chance. Acting as Buddha's voice, Lin challenges the Monkey King to leap off Buddha's hand to win ruler-ship over Heaven, or suffer a period of penance if he fails. Monkey King fails as the entire Universe resides on Buddha's palm. The Monkey King is imprisoned in a mountain. Before the mountain is fully closed off, Lin is allowed to say goodbye to Monkey King, who finally admits how important Lin has become to him, and leaves him his staff for company.Five hundred years later, an enlightened Monkey King is freed from his prison by a monk, a pig, and a river spirit at Buddha's behest. They invite him to join them on a journey to the West, to which he happily agrees.",

        "synopsis": "Owen Browning (Adam DeVine) is a young bank manager about to marry Parker McDermott (Nina Dobrev), whose estranged parents contact her to come to the wedding. He's excited he's finally going to meet them, as she's concerned they can be a bit much.Owen's parents Neil (Richard Kind) and Margie (Julie Hagerty) are difficult. Owen calls to tell them the good news about Parker's parents attending the wedding. He first has to hear about an odd nickel allergy of a guest, then they show their ignorance of Parker's profession as a yoga instructor, believing it involves a stripper pole. Rather than being happy about the news that the other in-laws are coming, they criticize them for being absent in Parker's life.At the bank, Owen has to free an employee who's been played upon by being locked in the vault. So, he shows and talks about how state-of-the-art their bank's security system is. They point out their rival bank's vault security is considered the best in the state. Owen also points out all vaults have an emergency escape latch.Out at dinner with his parents, they talk about the soon appearance of Parker's parents. Meanwhile, Owen talks with the storage space facility where Parker's parents rent a locker as he's hoping to access photos of the Parkers for a wedding photo montage. His call inadvertently alerts the crime boss Rehan (Poorna Jagannathan) to their return, when the storage space manager tells Rehan about Owen inquiring about the McDermott's locker.The following night, the McDermotts let themselves into their home while Parker is still out leading a yoga class and scare Owen. They insist he calls them Billy (Pierce Brosnan) and Lilly (Ellen Barkin). Owen and Parker tell Billy and Lilly that they met at Parker's yoga class due to Owen's hip issues. He went to her class for a year and a half before Parker finally asked him out.\nThe next day, Owen takes off work to spend the day with the in-laws. They pick the agenda, so they go skydiving, get tattoos, and drink. The McDermotts are adventure freaks while Owen is a totally laid back, peace loving, normal guy.The next day, an infamous full-costumed pair of criminals called the \"Ghost Bandits\" hold up the bank. As the robbery occurs during his wedding week, specific indicators such as the male's cologne, flashbacks to the bar, and what he told Lilly the previous day lead Owen to believe that the robbers might be his future in-laws. Owen had told Lilly about all the codes and the security measures to break into the vault.\nUnknown to Owen, Rehan had met Billy at the bar the previous night. Billy had told Owen that he knows nothing.FBI special agent Roger Oldham (Michael Rooker) questions Owen as the bank manager with his in-laws behind him. Not able to say anything, Parker insists they leave once he breaks out in tears. Oldham has dedicated most of his career chasing the Ghost Bandits and he's convinced they are behind the robbery.\nOwen know that if the McDermotts robbed the bank, then he did too, as he told Lilly the codes.Trying to enlist his parents' help in outing the McDermotts, Owen tells them his suspicions. They do ask direct inappropriate questions at dinner, but Billy and Lilly expertly redirect the conversation. Parker later asks Owen, but she thinks his theory is crazy.The next day, Owen follows his in-laws to Rehan's and hears her threaten to kill Parker if they don't get her $5,000,000 more before the wedding. Billy had just paid Rehan $ 1 million, as that was the amount that Billy and Lilly stole from her. But Rehan wants the $ 5 million as penalties and interest. She gives them till end of the week to come up with the cash.\nOldham stops Owen on the highway, finds planted evidence in the trunk (burner phones, voice modulators which makes it look like Owen robbed his own bank), and spills it on his in-laws. Oldham puts a wire on him, hoping to get the McDermotts to confess. Instead, Rehan shows up with her henchmen and takes Parker hostage as insurance. Disgusted, Owen joins forces with his in-laws.\nMcDermotts say that Rehan was their partner. She would choose the banks. But she started losing it and they were afraid that they would find out about Parker. So, at the last heist, they took the money and ran.\nOwen says that he knows everything about banks and can help them rob $ 5 million in 2 days.They first choose Victory Union Bank to rob as the bank manager is lazy. However, they lose most of the cash through a comedy of errors. They are able to steal the money from the armored car which was taking the cash from the bank, but the security kicks in and due to Owen's ineptitude, their getaway car is disabled. Owen eventually gets into the armored car, and rescues Billy and Lilly. But the cash was in their getaway car. They are pursued by the police, but Owen drives through a cemetery. The armored car smashes through the headstones, but the cop cars are not able to.So, then they focus on Atlas Reserve. Owen goes in, asking it's manager Phoebe King (Lauren Lapkus) how he can better equip his bank. Phoebe is the best bank manager in the business and every inch of her bank is triple secured. Phoebe's arrogance kicks in, so she shows him all of the safeguards with him. Just as the safe open, the McDermotts create a diversion out front while Owen locks himself in and then uses the emergency escape latch to escape with the money.At the ransom drop, Rehan is pleasantly surprised that Owen brought the money, but will kill them anyway. He miraculously guns them down as the McDermotts distract the cops so Owen can sneak back into the vault with the money.As the McDermotts turn themselves in and help Oldham with his ex, he lets them go briefly to Owen and Parker's wedding reception.\nDuring the credits, Owen slips a paperclip into a piece of cake for his new in-laws to use to get free of their handcuffs.",

        "synopsis": "Jess and Bill Walker are raising CC, Wyatt and Miles in an LA suburb. The night before Jess, CC and Wyatt all have potentially life-changing challenges, they do a family excursion to a planetarium. There, they are all arguing vehemently when they ask an apparently random woman to take their photo.Angelica observes them all bickering, all saying they wished their corresponding parent-child could know what it's like to walk in their shoes. When she snaps the picture, a strange and powerful cosmic blast strikes the telescope, knocking the family off the platform, and damaging the telescope.They wake in the morning with architect Jess body switched with 17 y.o. soccer star CC, and guitarist Bill with 13 y.o. Yale candidate Wyatt. Just when they realize the planetarium blast likely caused the transformation, they see that Miles and their dog Pickles also switched.Seeing the French Bulldog tearing across the lawn, the family follows close behind. They finally catch up with their baby/dog at their neighnor Rolf's, who offers to teach Pickles obedience.All six of them go to the planetarium and are told the telescope is being repaired, and Bill bribes maintainence to finish by evening. Accepting that they have to make do for the day, they leave Miles/Pickles with Rolf.Jess/CC accompanies CC/Jess to work to coach her through an important presentation, which could get her a promotion. The teen binges ice cream while Jess/CC preps her index cards. Awkward from the start, CC/Jess soon has to hurry to the toilet when her lactose intolerance hits. Afterwards they go to the champonship game. Eventually Jess/CC rallies, but tends to an injured opponent instead of making the winning goal.Meanwhile, the extroverted Bill/Wyatt is accompanied to the high school by the socially awkward Wyatt/Bill and quickly puts him on others' radar. However, his 'cool' demeanor doesn't impress the Yale reps. While waiting in the hall, Wyatt's lifetime friend and crush Ariana approaches Bill/Wyatt, confesses her feelings for Wyatt and invites him to a party.In the evening, the Walkers return to the telescope, but discover a lense is missing, which will have to be sent from Switzerland. Dejected, they bump into Angelica outside, who's a Lyft driver and drives them home.Bill/Wyatt and Jess/CC sneak off to the party, while their 'adult' counterparts are cornered by Jess' monthly moms gathering. They cut it short to hurry off to the teen party. Bill/Wyatt blocks Ariana from kissing him and punches out Wyatt's bully. Wyatt/Bill and Jess/CC arrive, just as CC/Jess is livening the party with a 'Bust a Move' dance routine. 30 The family must continue in the switched bodies, but now CC/Jess insists the whole project team participates in the presentation. She discovers that her mom constantly sings her praises and sacrifices tons to support her soccer camps. Jess/CC aces CC's math test and discovers how well CC's doing. When they see each other again, they both apologize.Before they can start the presentation, Bill/Wyatt calls the rest of the family to Bill's band Dad or Alive's show, as Wyatt/Bill is missing. They find him hiding in the toilets, afraid to perform in front of millions of viewers. Feeling he needs everyone's help to do it, he enlists his family as back up vocals. Initially shaky, by the end of the song, Wyatt/Bill finds his voice, and Dad or Alive is selected to go on to Hollywood. Jess' team and Mr. Molson come to tell her that Atlas won the account, and Jess the promotion.As Wyatt's contact at SpaceX gets the missing lense, the Walkers race to the planetarium to place it on the telescope. Although all six of them are on the platform, nothing happens. Disappointed, Angelica gives them a lift home. As they climb out, CC/Jess wishes Angelica a merry Christmas and states that they weren't successful in fixing the telescope and Angelica points out they were to 'fix what's broken'.On Christmas morning, the Walkers wake up in the living room to find themselves back to normal. Wyatt gets notification that Yale doesn't believe he's ready yet. Then he finds Ariana outside and they share their first kiss.

Accepting an invitation from their friend, Vikram \"The Maharajah\" Govindan (Adeel Akhtar), to attend his wedding on his private island, they hope their association with him will lend their failing detective agency some professional credibility.There, they meet Vik's French fiance Claudette Joubert (M\u00e9lanie Laurent), his flirtatious business partner Francisco Perez (Enrique Arce) (claims to have slept with 10000 women), his former fiance Countess Sekou (Jodie Turner-Smith) and her lady-in-waiting Imani (Zurin Villanueva), his reticent sister Saira (Kuhoo Verma), his ruthless bodyguard Lou (Myo Leong), and their old friend Colonel Ulenga (John Kani), who is now missing his left arm after saving Vik from an assassination attempt in Mumbai.At the wedding, Audrey notices a cloaked figure following Vik's elephant. A dead body falls from the elephant and turns out to be Vik's bodyguard, Lou. Nick suspects that it is a diversion and watches Vik's abduction by a mysterious figure. Realizing that they are once again ensnared in a conspiracy, the couple determine that at least two perpetrators must have been involved: one to create the diversion and the other to kidnap Vik. Only the board members knew about the elephant being part of the ceremony. So, they are all suspects now.\nFrancisco tells Nick and Audrey that Claudette had to sign a brutal prenup, which the board insisted on, before marrying Vik. Saira tells them tat Claudette is just wrong for Vik. Claudette tells them that Vik knew Francisco's dark secret. Sekou says that Francisco has 85 paternity suits against him and is siphoning money from the company to pay for it.The next morning, the group is joined by a team of professional detectives led by former MI6 hostage negotiator Connor Miller (Mark Strong). Nick and Audrey try to impress Miller, but Miller considers them as a suspect since their business is failing and they need the money. The kidnapper calls and tasks Nick to deliver a ransom of $70 million to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in exchange for Vik.Traveling to Paris, Miller takes Nick and Audrey to the exchange point with the $70 MM in cash. The kidnappers force the couple into a van at gunpoint. Inside, the couple fights them, ending with the kidnappers dead and the van crashing into Caf\u00e9 Procope. They realize they are being framed for Vik's abduction with footage of Nick running out of the tent brandishing a knife; Miller arrives and clarifies that the footage is a deep-fake. After taking the briefcase of money and asking them to meet him at the La Madeleine, Miller is seemingly killed when his car explodes. A mysterious figure steals the briefcase, only to be robbed of it when hit by a truck. The truck driver walks away with the case.With the assistance of Inspector Laurent Delacroix (Dany Boon), the couple trace the truck to a countryside chateau where they are ambushed by Sekou and Imani, who insist they are not the kidnappers and only want the money. Sekou shoots Imani and attempts to kill the couple, but is herself shot dead by a dying Imani. Nick and Audrey escape and call de la Croix and the others, requesting that they tell the kidnappers that Vik be brought to the Le Jules Verne restaurant at the Eiffel Tower and they will hand over the money.\nVik appears at the rendezvous, strapped into a bomb vest. Nick reasons that the killer would never jeopardize the ransom. As he predicts, the bomb's countdown is suspended and Miller, the mastermind of the abduction, appears; he had faked his death by hiding in a bomb-proof titanium chamber within the car moments before the explosion. He attempts to kill the group, along with Susan (Jillian Bell), a lonesome widow that was looking for her long lost lover Gary (they had promised each other to meet at the Eiffel Tower after 10 yrs on that very night), but Audrey clings to his harness and is pulled to the top floor.Nick pursues them, subdues Miller's men, and destroys the detonator. Miller throws Audrey, who is still connected to his harness, off the tower. The two men engage in hand-to-hand combat, culminating with Nick opening the briefcase and dispersing the money into the wind.\nMeanwhile, the group helps disengage Vik's bomb, and Susan tends to de la Croix, who was shot by Miller. Susan and de la Croix instantly fall in love after de la Croix shows her how to make circles with smoke (from his vape).\nUp on the top floor, Audrey reappears and helps Nick tie Miller's harness to the tower's elevator mechanism, throwing him into the rotor blades of his getaway helicopter, which explodes and crashes into the Seine.Returning to the restaurant, Audrey mistakes Saira's darkened hand for blood, but Saira insists her henna smeared during the commotion. Audrey realizes that Saira was not present when Vik's elephant was ushered into the reception ceremony, and recalls that the cloaked figure who killed Lou had a wet henna stain on their clothes. Saira is the second conspirator; she was upset that Vik's parents gave him sole control over the business, and she had previously tried to kill Vik in Mumbai. Exposed, Saira attempts to shoot Vik but he is shielded by Ulenga-who loses his right arm, then Claudette knocks her out with the briefcase.With the commotion concluded, Vik and Claudette decide to elope and give Nick and Audrey $10 million (in a dinosaur leather briefcase worth $3 MM). On a honeymoon in Greece, they are accosted at gunpoint by their supposedly European helicopter pilot who turns out to be American; he steals the millions and jumps out of the helicopter, leaving them scrambling for the controls.",

        "synopsis": "An unnamed U.S. military operative, known as \"the Mother\" (Jennifer Lopez), brokers an arms smuggling deal between ex-SAS Captain Adrian Lovell (Joseph Fiennes) and arms dealer Hector \u00c1lvarez (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal). Romantically involved with them both, she ends up becoming pregnant. After discovering that they are involved with child trafficking, the Mother approaches the FBI to be an informant.While the Mother is being interrogated at a safe house by FBI Special agent William Cruise (Omari Hardwick), Lovell attacks the property; Cruise is shot and wounded, and the other FBI agents are killed. The Mother saves Cruise's life and crafts a time-delayed bomb. Lovell confronts her in the bathroom and stabs her before getting knocked out by the explosion. After the ordeal, the Mother gives birth to a girl prematurely in the hospital.SAIC Eleanor Williams (Edie Falco) informs the Mother that Lovell's body was missing and that her new born daughter will be placed with a foster family for protection. Eleanor says that Lovell stabbed Mother's pregnant belly and so it is reasonable to assume that if he finds out about the daughter, he will come after her.\nMother had back-to-back tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. 46 confirmed kills and accurate to 1300 m with an M24.\nUnderstanding that the child will never be safe with her, she reluctantly waives parental rights. The Mother visits Cruise, giving him three conditions: the child will have a life as ordinary as possible, she'll get a photo every birthday, and to call her if she is in jeopardy. Mother saved Cruise's life, so he agrees. The Mother then secludes herself in a remote cabin in Alaska for the next twelve years, until Cruise contacts her to meet in Ohio.Cruise informs her that when the ATF busted some of \u00c1lvarez's men in Mexico, they found a photo of her daughter, Zoe (Lucy Paez), suggesting they're onto The Mother. While Cruise and the Mother are shadowing Zoe playing at a park, \u00c1lvarez's men kidnap Zoe. The Mother manages to gun down several of them before escaping the cops with Cruise. While he thinks Zoe's kidnapping is for ransom, she knows it was done to lure her out of hiding. She had identified the man leading the kidnapping to be Alvarez's top lieutenant, the Tarantula.They head to Havana, Cuba in hopes of uncovering a clue to Zoe's whereabouts. They catch Tarantula (Jesse Garcia), \u00c1lvarez's lieutenant, who reveals that she is being held at \u00c1lvarez's house on \"the Plantation\". Tarantula says that Alvarez will do unspeakable things to Zoe, and is not likely to make an exchange with Mother for Zoe. Mother kills Tarantula after torturing him.That night Mother reveals to Cruise that Lovell was ex-SAS training her sniper unit in Afghanistan. Lovell recruited her for covert, off the books operations as she had no family and no future. After that Mother did a tour in Guantanamo bay, where she saw Alvarez siphon guns off the base under everyone's noses. Mother brought Alvarez and Lovell together. Alvarez had the weapons and Lovell had the network to sell them and distribute them. She got into a relationship with both.\nMother discovers that Alvarez and Lovell were trafficking children.Infiltrating his home, together, they rescue Zoe. The Mother then kills \u00c1lvarez. Alvarez wanted to know if Zoe was his daughter, but Mother is clear that it doesn't matter.While escorting Zoe back home, the Mother's gaze upon her makes Zoe realize that she is her biological mother. The Mother decides to part ways and let Cruise return her to her foster parents. Lovell manages to intercept them. The Mother arrives, attacks Lovell and escapes with Zoe. Angered, Lovell kills Cruise.Realizing Zoe is not safe if she returns home, the Mother takes her to the cabin. Mother calls Zoe's foster parents and informs them that Zoe is safe, but cannot return to her normal life just yet. Mother promises to return Zoe to them, safe.\nOver time, she teaches the reluctant girl survival training. Mother teaches Zoe how to drive, run, shoot, identifying danger signs in nature and so on. Zoe is angry that Mother still won't admit that she is Zoe birth mother.\nMother explains that Zoe has to learn to protect herself.Zoe is bit by wolf pups in the wild. Mother takes her to the hospital, but Zoe gives out her real name by mistake, which is input into the computer. Mother realizes Lovell is coming for them, she decides to leave Zoe with Jons (Paul Raci), her former army colleague. Upset to know she's being abandoned again by her own mother, Zoe is confronted by Jons, who encourages her to see the Mother through her actions and not her words. After she finds a letter from the Mother, explaining everything she has ever done has been for her, Zoe decides to go back to the cabin and help her ward off the attackers.Lovell and his men have a final confrontation with the two. The Mother had mined the woods around the cabin. But Lovell finds the mines and uses the mines to destroy the cabin. Lovell's men see Zoe driving up to the cabin and Lovell goes for her.\nThe Mother manages to kill all of Lovell's men before facing him. Zoe was at a vantage point and Mother had told her to run, but Zoe decides to fight instead. She shoots Lovell through Mother's shoulder, proving that she is now as ruthless as Mother is.\nWhile Mother is knocked out, Lovell grabs Zoe and speeds away, but the Mother snipes and kills him. With her former allies dead, the Mother returns Zoe to her adoptive family. No longer needing to remain in hiding, she continues to observe Zoe from a distance.",

        "synopsis": "On May 9, 2017, Reality Winner watches Fox News coverage on the firing of James Comey by President Donald Trump on the TV at her office. 25 days later, on June 3, Winner returns home from grocery shopping where she is confronted by FBI agents Taylor and Garrick, who explain they have a warrant to search her house and her belongings. As a team of agents arrive and begin searching the house, Winner engages in casual conversation with the agents, all of which is picked up by recording device, the transcript of which forms the basis of the film's dialogue. During the early portion of the recording, Winner expresses concern for her pet dog and cat's safety during the search. Winner agrees to speak with Taylor and Garrick in an empty, disused bedroom in her house. Garrick and Taylor start to question Winner asking about the specifics of her work. She explains, besides working as a yoga instructor and CrossFit trainer, she is a Farsi translator for a government contractor and is hoping to be deployed to Afghanistan as a translator so her fluency in Pashto can be better utilized. The agents eventually reveal they are questioning Winner regarding the recent leak of classified government documents to an online publication. Winner initially denies knowledge, but over the course of an hour is eventually compelled to confess she printed and leaked a document from the National Security Agency's database. The film initially redacts specifics of the leak, as is done in the transcript, but eventually it is revealed that the documents revealed proof of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and the publication was The Intercept, which had put out a call for evidence of Russian interference. Winner denies wishing to be a whistle-blower or undermine the intelligence community \u00e0 la Edward Snowden, instead expressing she wished for the American public to have the same information the government had regarding the election. As the interrogation wraps up, she chiefly expresses concern for her pets as she realizes she will be taken into custody. She is escorted out of her house and handcuffed, as footage is shown of media reports regarding the leak. Winner receives both praise and criticism for her actions, with some accusing her of colluding with the Middle East or denying the veracity of the leaks altogether. Some outlets criticize The Intercept for allowing the leak to be traced back to Winner, and others theorize that Winner's punishment was designed to discourage potential whistle-blowers. A textual epilogue explains that Winner was denied bail and charged under the Espionage Act. She spent four years in jail and will remain on supervised release until November 2024. It notes that the same document Winner leaked was later used on Senate floor as evidence of Russian interference.",

        "synopsis": "Keith Gill is a lower middle class man working as a financial analyst in Brockton, Massachusetts. During his spare time, he regularly frequents the stock market subreddit r/WallStreetBets, posting his opinions on it via YouTube live streams under the name Roaring Kitty. He struggles to provide for his family, and his YouTube work is constantly mocked by his brother Kevin as nerdy garbage.In July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Keith notices that video game retailer GameStop's stock is falling and sinks his life savings into buying stock in it, regularly live streaming updates with his viewers. Despite Kevin and several peers claiming this is a waste of time, by January 2021, activity on r/WallStreetBets reveals that several hedge fund investment firms, including Melvin Capital Management and its founder Gabe Plotkin, have been short selling stock in the chain on the assumption it would close, causing a mass increase in GameStop's overall stock price when online stock buyers, including struggling nurse Jennifer, GameStop retail employee Marcos, and lesbian college couple Riri and Harmony, start aggressively buying stock, causing Plotkin and other investment CEOs to lose hundreds of millions within the same timeframe and Keith to be heralded as a financial guru.Things take a turn when r/WallStreetBets is temporarily shut down for 'inflammatory and vulgar content', causing a mass surge of panic selling in GameStop's stock in an attempt to beat a perceived price drop. When the commission-free stock trading website Robinhood is unable to adequately pay the money for the sales, co-chairman Vlad Tenev, at the behest of Citadel LLC owner Ken Griffin, halts all purchasing of GameStop's stock in an attempt to drive down the price. The play ultimately works, but the subsequent negative backlash results in an investigation by the United States House Committee on Financial Services, with Tenev, Griffin, Plotkin, and Keith all being subpoenaed, the former three for their roles in the fiasco and the latter on suspicion of using the situation to trick the public into making himself rich. As the investors struggle to defend their actions, Keith adamantly denies any wrongdoing, stating he was only doing what anyone with a passing awareness of investment banking would do in that situation.In the aftermath, post text shows how several of the individuals were affected: Plotkin was forced to shut down Melvin Capital because of the net losses the incident caused; Robinhood was the target of several lawsuits following the fiasco and wound up starting in the stock market significantly lower than it was prior; Harmony was able to use the money she obtained to pay off her family's debt issues and continues her relationship with Riri; Marcos sold half of his GameStop stock and quit his position in the company; Jennifer remains in debt but has retained her shareholding; Keith retired from YouTube in late April to get out of the public eye and sold part of his stocks to get Kevin an expensive car as a way to stop his nagging about how he will not loan him his car for his food deliveries.",

        "synopsis": "Novelist James Foster and his wife Em spend time at a resort in the fictional seaside country of Li Tolqa,[3] where a local festival is underway. The couple's chronic marital strife is exacerbated when Gabi, a fan of the only novel James has published to date, invites them to spend time with her and her husband Alban. The four have dinner and decide to spend the next day driving in the countryside, even though they have been warned that tourists are to remain on the resort compound at all times.At a beach, as James urinates behind a tree, Gabi unexpectedly grabs him from behind and proceeds to give him a handjob. After a long day of sunbathing and cooking, the tourists embark on a drunken drive back to their hotel. En route, James accidentally runs over a local man, killing him. Gabi insists that they cannot call the police, as the country is corrupt and they will not be safe.The next day, James is arrested and is told that the penalty for his crime is death at the hand of the dead man's firstborn son. However, the country has a unique system of justice whereby the guilty, for a hefty fee, can be cloned and have their duplicates killed in their place. James, who married into money, pays the fee to have a double killed before his eyes. Em is horrified by the entire affair and wants to leave immediately, but James is titillated by the spectacle and wants to stay. He hides his passport, claiming that he has lost it, and encourages Em to return to the United States.James extends his stay by a week and encounters Gabi and Alban again. They introduce him to a small group of Western tourists who all have been convicted of serious crimes and have paid to watch their doubles killed. These people return to the resort annually, commit heinous crimes, and pay to watch their doubles get slaughtered. Over the next several days, they encourage James to transform into a libertine criminal, encouraging him to kill locals, engage in intoxicated orgies, and abuse the resort staff.James is rattled one night when he is tricked into brutalizing a clone of himself he had been led to believe was the police detective who initially arrested him. In a moment of clarity and panic, James retrieves his hidden passport and attempts to flee, but the tourist group accosts him and abducts him from the bus transporting him to the airport. Gabi reveals that she finds him pathetic and that the group is abusing him for their own amusement, hoping to turn him into a fellow murder tourist. He runs off into a nearby wilderness. Gabi shoots him in the leg as he flees.After hours of wandering, James collapses at a farm, where a local family takes him in to recuperate. In his drugged state, he experiences a series of hallucinations. Once he has regained his strength, he is again confronted by Gabi's group, who orders him to kill a duplicate of himself to complete his transformation. He initially refuses, but when the clone attempts to kill him, James beats him to death. As a reward, Gabi exposes her bare breast to James, inviting him to breastfeed.The next day, as they head back to the United States, the other tourists casually chat about upcoming errands, while James is visibly shaken from the events of the past few days. Waiting in the airport for his flight, he resolves to remain behind instead. He returns to the closed resort, where he sits alone amidst the downpour of the monsoon.",

As Jamie grieves Pam's death, she helps Amelia put the finishing touches on a time machine she created for a school project and is approached by reporter Chris Dubasage, who tells her that Pam received a note from the killer that she kept secret: \"You're next, one day.\"At night, Jamie is chased by the killer and hides in the time machine, which activates and sends her back to 1987. She realizes that if she stops the Sweet 16 Killer's original spree, she can save Pam's life.

        "synopsis": "Marcus Marokovich, a hot tempered but skilled assistant coach with a minor league basketball team in Iowa, lets his temper get the best of him during a game and shoves the head coach, Phil. After leaving the stadium, he gets drunk at a local bar and while driving home he hits a police car, ending up in jail. The next day he is bailed out by Phil. He gets into an argument with Phil, believing that he was right and if Phil had listened, none of the previous night would've happened. Phil explains why he didn't listen to Marcus and advises him that he needs to get to know players as more than that and that they have personal lives that affect their playing. He then tells Marcus he's been let go by the owners.When Marcus appears for his hearing, the judge gives him a choice of 18 months in prison or 90 days of community service with a local community center's intellectually challenged basketball team, The Friends. He agrees to community service and soon realizes coaching this team will be a personal and professional challenge. At the end of the first practice, he accepts a ride home with Johnny, one of the players, only to find that the driver is a former Tinder one night stand and Johnny's sister, Alex. He and Alex begin a casual sexual relationship while he learns how to coach the new team.The team begins to improve and Marcus soon realize that the players are more than just their skills as he gets to know them personally. As one of the team members, Darius, refuses to play for Marcus, a formerly injured player, Consentino, is put back in the rotation and Marcus meets her on their way to an away game. The team is kicked off the bus when the team \"disrupts\" the other passengers and Johnny calls his sister to pick them up in her Shakespeare travel RV. Fortunately, Marcus and the team are able to convince her to be their driver for away games.Johnny becomes more attached to Marcus and invites him to dinner and once there, Marcus shares Johnny's news about moving into a group home with some of The Friends. Alex becomes defensive and tells Marcus to stay out of family business and he leaves the home, but Alex confronts him in the yard and after an argument, tells Marcus they are over. Johnny becomes angry with Marcus for hurting his sister and lying to him and refuses to play but during halftime of a game, Consentino lets him know he isn't playing for coach, he's playing for the rest of the team so he needs to get over it.Marcus has asked one of the assistant coaches with his former team, Sonny, who has an uncle that is a GM with the NBA to help him find a new job but his uncle shuts him down. Sonny leads Marcus on for a while, hoping they will become friends but realizes Marcus was just being nice to him to get an NBA job. When Marcus realizes how manipulative he's been, he asks Sonny to help him with coaching The Friends and he agrees.Benny, one of the players that works at a local restaurant, has been unable to play in games because his boss refuses to allow him to adjust his schedule. Once the team is able to make it to the semi-finals, he tells his boss he should be able to adjust his schedule to play with the team and is fired, but he is now able to play and is one of the key scorers. Marcus and Phil meet by chance in a restaurant and Phil lets Marcus know that Darius, the teammate who refuses to play for Marcus, has a promising career before he was involved in a terrible car accident and ended up with brain damage. Marcus realizes it was a drunk driver who hit Darius and he goes to his home just to apologize and explain he would never drive drunk again, but that he understand why Darius won't play for him. Darius realizing he needs to be able to forgive the woman that hit him, decides to begin with Marcus and agrees to go to the Special Olympics finals in Winnipeg.Marcus receives news that he has been hired by the NBA team in Seattle as a third assistant but Alex tells him it sounds like they are using his feel-good story as a cover for their current scandal. When he tells The Friends he is moving to Seattle, they cannot bring themselves to be happy, knowing it will take him away and Johnny becomes angry with him again. Marcus is told by the community center manager, Julio, that the city and state do not have the money to send the players to Canada so he devises a scheme with Alex to blackmail the owner of the restaurant where Benny worked and they are able to attend the finals. The Friends are intimidated by the size and name of the opposing team, The Beasts, and it shows in their playing, so when they are down during the halftime, Marcus brings up all the situations that they've conquered and calls them Champions. When returning to the court, Johnny proceeds up the stairs to have his Champion moment by telling Alex he is moving in with his friends.The Friends rally during the second half and are within one point of winning, so Marcus tries to set up a play that will have Darius making the final shot. His assistant coach says it's a bad idea as the other team knows Darius is the best player and they will be all over him. Marcus begins to reprimand him like Phil had done to him but catches himself and realizes the assistant is right and sets up a pick and roll play with Johnny. The play works and Johnny is about to make the basket when another player, Showtime, yells he is open and Johnny passes him the ball, only for Showtime to make his trademark move of a backward shot. He misses the basket but hits the rim and the team goes wild because he had never before even hit the backstop. Sadly it results in the team's loss but they still see themselves as Champions because of Marcus's pep talk.Marcus decides not to take the Seattle job, realizing that Alex was right and he is offered a local coaching job in place of his former boss with the JV Iowa team. His former assistant takes over the coaching of The Friends, Marcus and Alex being dating, and Johnny moves in with his friends at the group home.",

However, Christopher left after he entered college. Without him around to feed them, and with the arrival of winter, the creatures went into starvation. In order to survive, they settled on killing and eating Eeyore, which developed in them a hatred for humanity. They vowed to return to their feral instincts and never speak again.Five years later, Christopher, now an adult, returns to the Hundred Acre Wood, accompanied by his wife Mary, but finds the place in a desolate state. The couple is ambushed by Piglet, who fatally strangles Mary. Pooh and Piglet then drag Christopher into the woods, showing him Eeyore's skeletal remains, and burning Mary's corpse. Sometime later, university students Maria, Jessica, Alice, Zoe, and Lara rent a cabin in the Hundred Acre Wood so she can overcome a traumatic stalking experience. Tina, another friend, gets lost en route, and Pooh grinds her up with a woodchipper. In his treehouse, Pooh, who has imprisoned Christopher, reminisces over their childhood and breaks down, brutally whipping him with Eeyore's tail and showering Christopher in Mary's blood.As night falls, Pooh and Piglet ambush Lara and slowly drive a car over her head. Piglet enters the cabin, killing Zoe. Maria and Jessica observe the duo taking Alice away and decide to rescue her. In Pooh's treehouse, they find and free Christopher, who directs them to another hostage, Charlene. Seeking revenge after Piglet mutilated her face, Charlene summons Piglet to kill him, but Piglet mauls her to death. Pooh chases Maria and Jessica into the woods, but Alice stays behind and bludgeons Piglet with his own sledgehammer, apparently fatally. Pooh impales Alice with a knife through her open mouth.On the road, Maria and Jessica seek help from a group of local men passing by but Pooh easily kills them. Maria tries to run him over with their pick-up truck but crashes. Upon awakening, she witnesses Pooh decapitate Jessica. He almost kills Maria until Christopher appears, driving a car and crushing Pooh between the two vehicles.Pooh frees himself and holds Maria at knifepoint. Christopher pleads for Pooh to release her, promising to stay with him and apologizing. Pooh breaks his vow of silence and says \"You left\" before slashing Maria's throat. After she dies in his arms, a traumatised Christopher flees, realising that his former friend is now beyond help, while Pooh repeatedly stabs Maria's corpse.",

        "synopsis": "Emily Meyers (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke Edmunds (Alden Ehrenreich) are analysts at One Crest Capital, a cutthroat Manhattan hedge fund. The two are in a passionate relationship they keep secret from their co-workers (Dax (Brandon Bassir), Rory (Sebastian De Souza), Arjun (Sia Alipour)). Luke proposes to Emily while at his brother's wedding, and she happily accepts.The next day at work, one of the company's portfolio managers named Quinn is fired. Emily overhears her colleagues mention that Luke is being considered as a replacement, and passes the news onto him; the two celebrate that night. However, the firm's CEO Campbell (Eddie Marsan) summons Emily to a meeting late in the night to tell her that she will in fact be receiving the promotion. Emily reluctantly breaks the news to Luke, but he expresses his support.As Emily settles into her new job, Luke's resentment over not being promoted becomes increasingly apparent, leading to tensions in his relationship with Emily. Luke now works for Emily, and she tells him what to do at work.\nEmily tells Luke that Campbell doesn't think highly of Rory and when Rory gets fired, she will pitch for Luke. But Emily makes Luke work hard and Luke is slow, so this means he has to spend long hours at work to complete the tasks assigned by Emily.\nLuke privately becomes consumed with the work of a self-help guru coaching men on how to assert themselves in the workplace. Their sex life is strained; at one point Emily tries to initiate sex and Luke says he is not feeling up to it. She then crawls onto him and tells him that she doesn't care what he feels like, and that she would do all the work. He ultimately denies her and goes to bed.While out for drinks with Campbell and Paul (Rich Sommer), a senior executive at the fund, Emily learns that Campbell is seeking to get rid of Luke, considering him ineffectual. Luke's last big call lost the firm $15 million. Campbells also reveals that Luke was a favor that Campbell did for a friend, and eventually he wants Luke to leave.\nEmily attempts to advocate more for Luke in the workplace, but it backfires when Luke makes a poor trading call that loses the company $25 million, leading to Campbell harshly insulting her.\nLuke attempts to rectify his mistake by feeding Emily insider information confirming the rumored collapse of a company whose stock the fund can short. Concerned that the trade is illegal, Emily recommends Campbell to short another company, which proves successful; she receives a hefty commission of $575,000.\nEmily considers celebrating her success with Luke but opts to go to a strip club with her male co-workers instead after Luke ignores her attempts to celebrate. She comes home intoxicated, leading to a fight with Luke where he shames her for dressing and behaving like one of the prostitutes her colleagues habitually hire for their nightclub outings.When another portfolio manager Rory is fired the next day, Luke demands that Emily recommend him for the role to Campbell, but she hints that Campbell is not interested in promoting him. Luke then goes to Campbell's office and makes a grandiose speech pledging his loyalty to him, only to learn Campbell has already hired a new portfolio manager.\nThat night, Emily learns that her overbearing mother (Geraldine Somerville) has planned a surprise engagement party for them that Friday. Emily is livid since Luke hasn't informed even his parents yet and they are in no position to celebrate.\nA drunken Luke accuses Emily of stealing his job, but Emily reveals that Campbell wanted to fire him, leading Luke to storm out.\nTurns out Emily's mother had informed Luke's parents about the engagement and all the relatives are flying in. There is no calling it off now. Emily calls Luke and asks him to put their differences aside to attend the engagement party.The next day, while Emily, Campbell, and Paul pitch to overseas investors, Luke barges into the conference room intoxicated and causes a scene, berating Campbell for denying him a promotion and revealing his relationship with Emily, which has been in violation of company policy since her promotion.An infuriated Emily is unable to reach Luke over the phone, only to find him at the engagement party. The two argue in front of their families and guests, and Emily smashes a bottle on Luke's head when he suggests that she traded sexual favors for a promotion. Emily retreats to a bathroom where Luke finds her and the two argue further before having sex; after it has started, Emily tells Luke to stop, but he sexually assaults her, violently shoving her face against the bathroom sink.The next morning, to protect her job, Emily tells Campbell that Luke was stalking her and that the two were never in a relationship.\nEmily returns home to find Luke there, having packed up his belongings and planning to move in with his brother. Enraged by his nonchalant demeanor and demanding an apology for sexually assaulting her, Emily attacks Luke with a kitchen knife until he breaks down crying and begs for her forgiveness. Emily orders him to clean his blood off the floor and leave. She drops the knife and lets out a huff of laughter.",

        "synopsis": "Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla) were quite good at playing online games, and they spend most of their time doing that, which is why their parents, Terrence Tango (Zachary Levi) and Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez), had some strict rules in place. Terrence has these rules as Terence and Nora are spies and their computers host the top-secret Armageddon code, and they are afraid that someone might use their kids' computers to hack into their network and steal the Armageddon code.\nBoth spies are told by their boss Devlin that unknown assailants are trying to break into OSS servers to get to the Armageddon code.Tony and Patty were allowed to play games at a specified time during the day and for not more than a couple of hours. But that didn't stop Tony from sneaking out in the middle of the night and playing games with his sister. Patty didn't like it when they broke the rules, as she was the kind of person who believed that staying honest in one's life was of utmost importance. Tony didn't believe that, as he always said that one should have their way by hook or by crook. Patty tried to make him understand that maybe he benefited from speaking lies, but ultimately, he would have to pay the price for it. Tony took part in a competition organized by a gaming company that had created a game called Hyscore.As a prize for winning the competition, Tony got the game Hyscore, which hadn't been released up until then, installed on his computer. Tony had won the competition by cheating, but he was happy because he had gotten the desired result. In the night, both the kids came out and decided that they would check out how the game was. Tony's father used to change the password so that his kids weren't able to access any games after the prescribed hours. But Tony had found the password, and he used it to log in to the game. But as soon as the game started, the screen started flickering, and the device shut down. The kids didn't understand what was happening, so they immediately ran to their bedroom before their parents came and caught them red-handed.The creator of the game, Rey \"The King\" Kingston (Billy Magnussen), had deceived Tony, and he had entered the system to steal the Armageddon code. That code was used by OSS agents to enter any device, and Rey knew that if he was able to get his hands on it, he would be able to rule the whole world and make people act according to his wishes.\nMeanwhile, Terrence and Nora were having an argument about whether they should delete the Armageddon code, as they knew that if it fell into the wrong hands, it would not be good for the world. Terrence was against it as he argued that they have used the code themselves to hack strongly protected systems, but Nora made him unconscious and went to delete it.But before she could do that, Rey hacked the system and stole the Armageddon code. Soon, there was widespread chaos all over, and the game Hyscore, got installed on the devices of half of the world. Terrence came back to his senses, but the character of the game, Hyscore, waged an all-out attack at their residence. Terrence and Nora were able to send their kids to the safe house, but they couldn't escape and were taken into custody by Rey King Kingston. Nora gives Patty her locket before she got separated from them.Terrence had divided the Armageddon code into two halves, and that is why Rey was only able to hack into half of the devices in the world. He had realized that the second half of the code was in the locket that Patty wore, so he sent his men to kidnap the kids and bring them to his hideout.\nIn the meantime, Patty and Tony had figured out all the gadgets in the hideout and had trained themselves to be effective spies.\nThe hideout is found by OSS agents who bring the kids to Devlin. The kids unlock Devlin's systems and tell him that Ray Kingston is their suspect. Ray's goons attack the OSS HQ where Devlin had brought the kids. They steal the Armageddon code from the kids and escape via boats on the lake. The kids follow them using OSS gadgets. They find the location of their parents by reverse tracker Nora's tracker and fly there is a jet.Terrence, meanwhile, told Nora that the Armageddon code had been created by him, but Tony, the little boy, didn't even know about it.\nTerrence said that during the fireball mission, in which they killed Vargos and destroyed his laboratory, he had procured a blueprint for a weapon that Vargos had been making. Terrence knew that if he was able to understand that blueprint, he could use it to make a code through which they could break into any kind of device. But Terrence was never able to understand it fully, but one fine day, Tony entered his room, and thinking that it was a puzzle, he solved it.It is revealed that Rey Kingston was Vargos' son, and he believed that his father was trying to make the world a better place through his creations when the OSS team arrived and killed him in cold blood. Even Patty believed that Terrence and Nora could have found a way where they wouldn't have to kill everyone. She actually told her parents what they could have done in order to bring the situation under control without hurting anyone, and Terrence and Nora were a bit taken aback as it made sense, and surprisingly, it had never occurred to them.After the death of his father, Rey believed that the people of the world didn't deserve to be treated nicely. He wanted to bring about a change by hacking into their devices and making them act according to his wishes. What Terrence and Nora had believed to be their victory was actually their biggest failure, and their own daughter made them realize that. Terrence, Nora, and even Tony understood that what Patty was saying made sense and that for being a spy, they didn't necessarily have to be dishonest in their approach.Tony and Patty reached Rey Kingston's hideout, where they met their parents and took them out of the holding cell. But Rey was already a step ahead of them, and before they could do anything, he used the Armageddon code chip and initiated the process of hacking into the devices of the entire population of planet Earth.A countdown started, and Tony knew he had to do something about it before it was too late. He found the place where the main system was kept, and he did everything that he could to stop the countdown. But he realized that he was deceived by the King, as he had unknowingly armed the system. That's when the King arrived and told them they had been duped, and now he was going to wreak havoc on the world. Rey Kingston left the scene with a VR pod, and that's when Patty realized that if they could enter the game and stop Rey, then they could save the world.\nThey knew that Rey was controlling everything from inside the game, and all they needed was to find a way to defeat him. Terrence and Nora, in the direction of their kids, sat on the VR pods, and all four of them entered the virtual world of Hyscore. From Heck Knight to the King, the family faced every lethal villain who was a part of the game verse. Patty had requested everyone to play with all fairness, even if others resorted to dishonest means.It seemed like the King would defeat Tony, but Tony's honesty paid off, and he received an extra life, which was a sort of fair play award that was rarely given to the players. Tony defeated Rey, and Patty asked the OSS not to arrest him but to send him back into the virtual world so that he could become a better man.\nThe generosity and honesty of the kids moved Rey, and he realized that to change the world, he didn't have to resort to such cruel means and methods. The kids were called by Devlin (D. J. Cotrona) to the OSS office the next day, and he told them they were also being officially recruited as spies. Devlin promised that he would bring about a change in the spy manual and not tell his agents to resort to unfair means. It all ended well for the Spy family, and probably, in the next installment, we will see them taking up more missions and saving the world from crises.",

        "synopsis": "In 1984, Oregon-based Nike, Inc. is on the verge of shutting their basketball shoe division due to low sales. In response to this, Marketing VP Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman), along with co-founder and CEO Phil Knight (Ben Affleck), task Nike's high school basketball talent scout Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) to come up with a new spokesperson for Nike basketball shoes.\nThe company made a loss and Knight just had to fire 25% of the employees. The basketball division has an entire budget of $250,000. Sonny wants more, which Knight refuses. Nike dominated the running shoe market and a billion dollar business, but Knight is skeptical if people really even care about basketball shoes.Sonny is a gambler and spends a lot of his time in Vegas. He wins most of the time, but then has a habit to blow it all on one bad bet.\nIn 1984, Converse has a 54% share of the basketball shoe market, and Adidas has 29%. Nike is at 17% share. Nike offers more money for endorsements, yet high school basketball players, going to regional, want to sign for Adidas as they are considered \"hot\". Nike is considered a jogging company. Converse is the NBA all star shoe.\nHoward White (Chris Tucker) tells Sonny that he always signed player through their mothers. As boys listen to their mothers.\nThe Nike slogan \"Just do it\" apparently came from the last words of a convict who was facing a firing squad.While considering the basketball players chosen in the 1984 NBA draft, Nike's executives think third pick Michael Jordan (Damian Young) is off limits, being both a fan of Adidas and too expensive for the basketball division's meager budget. Nike is considering going after 3 players between the 5th and the 20th picks.\nSonny speaks to a grocery clerk who says that Jordan is over-rated and his success in high school is not likely to be converted in NBA. He got high in the draft pick due to the one shot which helped his team win the Championship at college level.\nHowever, once Sonny watches Jordan's highlights in conjunction with an Arthur Ashe commercial for his Head rackets, Vaccaro becomes convinced that Nike should pursue who he considers a generational talent, with both brand and athlete building off each other.Sonny argues to Strasser that Jordan was just 18 years old, yet the whole final play was designed around him. Even his coach saw greatness in him. Sonny wants the entire budget to sign Jordan. Nike to build a shoe around Jordan.\nDavid Falk is Jordan's agent and says that Jordan is an Adidas fan. Adidas is making a $250,000+ offer. Nike doesn't stand a chance. David says Jordan likes Adidas's tracksuits, where Nike doesn't even hold a candle to them.\nSonny tells Knight that he will bet his career to get Jordan in. Knight will only sign off if Sonny has a meeting, but David refuses to get a meeting with Jordan until Sonny makes a written offer. Sonny can't make a written offer as he is not authorized yet.Following dinner with his friend George Raveling (Marlon Wayans), who coached Jordan in the Olympic tournament, and asking for his support in courting the star. George supports Sonny but is clear that if Sonny doesn't close with Jordan, bypassing David could mean that Sonny loses his job.\nVaccaro travels to Wilmington, North Carolina, where he convinces Michael's mother Deloris (Viola Davis) that Nike would give Jordan all the attention that he would not receive from his preferred brands Adidas and Converse. Sonny tells Deloris exactly how the Converse and Adidas meetings would go and begs her to consider Nike, if she believes what he is saying is right.After receiving a negative phone call from Jordan's agent David Falk (Chris Messina) regarding contacting his client's family, Vaccaro learns that the Jordans have scheduled a meeting at Nike's Beaverton, Oregon headquarters the following Monday.\nVaccaro and Strasser start preparing their pitch while requesting shoe designer Peter Moore (Matthew Maher) to prepare a prototype, which Moore names \"Air Jordan\" after Nike's Air Sole technology. Those days NBA had a rule that a basketball shoe had to be 51% white. Sonny and Strasser decide to go beyond the 49% color and just pay the fine of $5000 per game to the NBE, for breaking that rule.\nIn the meantime, Knight agrees to assign the basketball division's entire $250,000 budget to hire Jordan.After the meeting with Jordan and his parents is successful, Vaccaro learns that Adidas matched the offer while adding a Mercedes Benz 380SL, and he thinks the deal will not go through. However, Vaccaro receives a call from Deloris, who states that Michael will sign with Nike on the condition he earns a percentage of every Air Jordan sold.Even though Vaccaro thinks the company's higher-ups would not accept this bonus, Knight is told he deems it necessary to ensure the endorsement.\nAn epilogue reveals the Air Jordan exceeded Knight's expectations of $3 million in sales, earning $162 million in its first year and becoming a steady source of income for Nike. Today Air Jordan does $4 Billion in annual sales for Nike.\nStrasser got the credit. Howard White became the founding father of the Air Jordan division at Nike. Michael ears $400 Million a year from Nike due to his revenue share. Nike bought Converse in 2003. David Falk sold his company for $100 million. Sonny was counted as one of the greatest sports reformers in history.\nDeloris runs charities. Her Air Jordan deal meant that billions more went to athletes and their families.",

        "synopsis": "In London, British-Pakistani teenager Ria Khan aspires to become a movie stunt-woman like her idol, Eunice Huthart. Under an alter-ego, \"The Fury\", Ria creates films of martial arts training with the help of her older sister Lena, who has dropped out of art school and moved back in with their loving but traditional parents, Fatima and Rafe, both of them discouraging Ria's dreams. At school, Ria is inseparable from her friends Clara and Alba, but their disapproving teacher urges her to pursue a more \"serious\" career. Ria's emails to Eunice about a potential mentor-ship go unanswered, and she is soundly defeated by the school bully Kovacs. The Khan family is invited to an Eid Mubarak soir\u00e9e by Raheela, the leader of Fatima's social circle of Pakistani mothers, at her lavish mansion. Ria realizes the party has been arranged to find a suitable match for Raheela's son Salim, a successful geneticist, but is unable to stop Lena from agreeing to a date. To Ria's horror, Lena is charmed by Salim and, after a few whirlwind weeks of dating, agrees to marry him and move to Singapore. Despite their parents' support, Ria's refusal to accept Lena's choices, including abandoning her art career, drives the sisters apart. Convinced there must be a more sinister explanation, Ria enlists Clara and Alba's help to spy on Salim. They concoct an elaborate plan to steal his laptop, and Ria distracts him while her friends hack his computer, but they find nothing incriminating. Desperate to sabotage Lena's relationship, Ria lashes out at her friends, and breaks into Salim's bedroom to plant used condoms. She is caught, and confronts Salim with a picture of his first wife, whom he explains died in childbirth. Furious, Lena berates Ria to give up the fantasies that her sister will change her mind about marriage, or that she will ever become a stunt-woman. At odds with her sister and ignored by her friends, Ria gives up martial arts. She visits Raheela to apologize and is dragged into joining her spa day, where Raheela reveals her true colors and tortures Ria with waxing. Fighting off Raheela's staff, Ria stumbles into the mansion's secret lab and discovers that all the eligible women at the Eid party were secretly scanned and tested, and Lena was selected for her fertility. Escaping back home, Ria realizes she cannot convince her family of the truth. She tells Clara and Alba, and together they devise a plan, persuading Kovacs to drive them to the wedding to rescue Lena. Ria distracts the guests with a dance while Clara and Alba, disguised as waiters, sneak past the armed guard at Lena's door. They chloroform Lena and hide her inside a tea trolley, but Raheela captures Ria, and reveals she and Salim plan to impregnate Lena with a clone of Raheela. Forced to return Lena, the friends are locked in the bridal suite as the wedding begins, but Kovacs comes to their rescue and subdues the guard. Taking his gun, Ria holds Raheela at gunpoint and exposes her plan, leading Lena to remember being drugged and tested by Salim, who admits that his first wife died carrying his mother's clone. Raheela seizes the gun but is disarmed by Fatima, as Ria's family and friends fight off the guests. Lena subdues Salim while Ria finally masters a reverse spinning kick to defeat Raheela, and the police arrive as the sisters drive off. Reconciling with Lena, Ria finally receives an encouraging email from Eunice, and the sisters celebrate together.",

        "synopsis": "In 1988, Henk Rogers of Bullet-Proof Software markets his newest video game at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. While there, he instead becomes enamored with the game \"Tetris\", created by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov, who works for ELORG in the Soviet Union. Rogers explains to a bank manager that Robert Stein of Andromeda Software had obtained the worldwide licensing rights to Tetris from ELORG, and signed a contract with media tycoon Robert Maxwell and his son, CEO of Mirrorsoft, Kevin Maxwell, allowing them to distribute Tetris in exchange for game royalties. Meanwhile, the Mirrorsoft representative at CES had sold Rogers the Tetris rights in Japan for PC, console, and arcade. Rogers then goes to Nintendo headquarters in Japan and obtains an audience with CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi, whom he convinces of Tetris' value. He turns down a buyout offer for the rights to Tetris, instead proposing a partnership, to which Yamauchi agrees. Rogers then asks for a loan to produce Nintendo cartridges and arcade machines, agreeing to heightened interest rates and putting up his apartment as collateral. His wife and business partner Akemi voices her concerns, but Rogers points out their children's obsession with the game and promises that his gambit will work. Shortly after beginning production, Rogers receives a call from Kevin, explaining that the arcade rights had already been promised to Sega. Rogers returns to Yamauchi, asking for his residuals in advance. Instead, he is sent to Nintendo of America headquarters in Seattle, and shown Nintendo's upcoming handheld device, the Game Boy, which is planned to be released with Super Mario Land. Rogers convinces president Minoru Arakawa and senior VP Howard Lincoln to package it with Tetris instead, and promises to obtain the handheld licensing rights. He travels to meet with the Maxwells in London, who tell him that Stein retains all worldwide licensing rights. Rogers attempts to purchase the handheld rights, but is dismissed. The Maxwells order Stein to secure the handheld rights. Kevin questions his father about millions of pounds missing from the employee retirement fund, but his questions are dismissed. Rogers meanwhile, meets Stein outside and offers $25,000 for the worldwide handheld rights, which Stein seemingly accepts. Later, however, Arakawa and Lincoln call Rogers explaining that Stein has now promised the handheld rights to Atari for $100,000. Kevin learns about this, and, while Stein promises to obtain the rights, both Kevin and Rogers decide to travel to Moscow to personally obtain them instead. Rogers struggles to locate ELORG headquarters until he meets a woman named Sasha, who offers to be Rogers' translator. She takes him to ELORG, warning him that entry without formal invitation is highly illegal; despite this, Rogers speaks to ELORG president Nikolai Belikov. With Sasha translating, Rogers explains that he licenses Tetris to Nintendo. Belikov however, has never heard of Nintendo and claims that ELORG only licensed Tetris for PC, and accuses Rogers of theft. Rogers promises to sort out the situation, and Belikov tells him to return the next morning. Outside, Rogers is confronted by a KGB agent, who warns him to return home. Kevin arrives in Moscow and is greeted by Valentin Trifonov, head of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The next morning, Rogers meets with Belikov and Alexey. Trifonov briefly interrupts to warn Rogers that he can return home or face the consequences of his crimes of fraudulently using a tourist's visa to conduct business and of false licensing, but Rogers refuses to leave. He promises Alexey that he will make him a millionaire, but Alexey explains that he receives no royalties for Tetris, despite having invented it. Rogers again defends himself to Belikov, and finds out that ELORG did not license the arcade rights either. Meanwhile, Stein and Kevin are also at ELORG to negotiate for handheld rights, though neither Rogers, Stein nor Kevin are aware of the others' presence. Rogers reviews the contract Stein originally signed and notes that because of the vague definition of the word \"computer,\" Stein had technically obtained the video game rights, though he had stolen the arcade rights. Belikov presents Stein with a new contract for arcade and PC rights. Rogers asks Alexey for a ride to his hotel, during which he attempts small talk. Alexey responds coldly, but, while it is illegal for USSR citizens to have foreigners in their homes, he gives Rogers his home address. Meanwhile, Trifonov meets with Kevin, explaining his lowly origins and that he believes the Soviet Union is dying. He also hints that Kevin should bribe him for help obtaining the rights. Although Kevin refuses, Robert promises Trifonov a large sum to help Kevin obtain them. Rogers goes to Alexey's apartment for dinner, where they bond over their passion for game design. Rogers plays the original version of Tetris on Alexey's personal computer, suggesting improvements to the game's mechanics. When a neighbor knocks on their door, Alexey and his wife fearfully hide Rogers. Alexey asks Rogers to leave, but Rogers asks Alexey to take him to a real Russian club, where he is surprised by the Russians' desire for freedom and love of the song \"The Final Countdown,\" and Alexey notes that he and Rogers are not so different. Afterwards, men from the Russian embassy in Tokyo threaten Rogers' family, while KGB officers beat him in an alley. He returns to his hotel and finds his room ransacked. Sasha arrives and tells Rogers that her room was also ransacked, and explains why the government considers him such a threat. She kisses him unexpectedly, but Rogers tells her he is married. The next morning, Trifonov speaks to Alexey and his sons, telling them to ask about what happened to Alexey's father. Rogers and Stein see each other hailing taxis the next morning. Stein signs the new contract, and Rogers makes an offer for the handheld rights, offering royalties per unit sold to make up for the small sum he can pay up front; he expects millions of units to be sold. Trifonov tells Belikov to sell to Mirrorsoft, even though Kevin offers no royalties. Belikov has Kevin sign a letter of intent, giving the handheld rights to Mirrorsoft if the company pays 1 million dollars within a week; however, he also secretly has Rogers sign a letter, giving him a window to make a stronger counteroffer, and also offers the video game rights to Rogers; he had redefined the word computer in Stein's new contract, eliminating the loophole that Stein had exploited. Alexey takes Rogers to Dzerzhinsky Square. On the way, he tells Rogers that his father was a university professor, and that when his father protested a colleague's arrest over selling a book abroad, the Soviet government ruined his family. He then points out Trifonov, and reveals that Sasha is actually a KGB agent working for Trifonov, before taking Rogers to the airport. When Rogers arrives home, he receives a fax from ELORG reneging his deal, and photos of him kissing Sasha to blackmail him into silence. He then receives a call from Lincoln stating that Nintendo is purchasing the rights from Mirrorsoft. As he despairs, Rogers angrily dismisses having missed his daughter's concert as unimportant, which upsets both her and Akemi.\nBelikov has Alexey fax Mirrorsoft's letter of intent to Rogers. Meanwhile, Kevin finds his father shredding numerous documents. When he questions why the company could not pay the million dollars, Robert again is dismissive. Rogers takes the letter to Lincoln and Arakawa, who are angrily discussing the loss of Tetris and their cartridge patent to Atari. However, since Mirrorsoft had not yet paid the million dollars they promised, both the worldwide video game and handheld rights were still available. The three travel back to Moscow to make another offer, and Trifinov has Alexey fired from his job and evicted from his apartment because of Rogers' return.\nRogers, Lincoln, and Arakawa meet with Belikov and make an offer for worldwide handheld and video game rights. Sasha, who is also present, forces Belikov to consider the offer overnight and informs Trifonov, who in turn informs Robert, giving him twenty-four hours to come up with the one million dollars originally promised. Stein angrily attacks Kevin for going behind his back, believing that Kevin had caused him to lose the video game rights, although Kevin denies this. The three realize that they possess neither video game nor handheld rights, and Robert and Kevin fly to Moscow to meet with Mikhail Gorbachev, asking for help, but Gorbachev refuses. Alexey meets with Rogers, angrily stating that they are not friends, and should return to their own worlds. As he returns home, he overhears Trifonov's orders to intercept Rogers' team from the agents watching him.\nThe Maxwells attempt to convince Belikov to give them the licensing rights, but Rogers' team interrupts and presents their own offer. Kevin accidentally forces Robert to admit that Mirrorsoft is bankrupt, and couldn't pay the one million dollars they promised. Belikov dismisses the Maxwells and signs Rogers' offer, warning that the three are not safe until they are out of Moscow. Trifonov confronts the Maxwells, inadvertently revealing the bribe to Sasha and Kevin. Trifonov's men attempt to intercept Rogers outside, but Alexey arrives in his car and helps Rogers escape. A car chase ensues, with Alexey getting to the airport ahead of Trifinov. When they hear police sirens, Rogers tells Alexey to return home, promising that it is not goodbye. Trifinov attempts to intercept Rogers, but he manages to trick him and the flight departs before Trifinov can board, and Sasha arrests him for corruption.\nWhen he arrives home, Rogers apologetically asks his daughter to perform her concert that he missed, and shows Akemi a check from Nintendo for five million dollars, reconciling with them both. The Game Boy goes on to become an enormous success worldwide. As the Soviet Union collapses, Rogers sends Alexey a Game Boy and plane tickets to America, and meets him in San Francisco, where the two embrace. Text then reveals that Stein continued licensing video games, and that Robert had stolen millions of pounds from employee funds, for which Kevin stood trial, and discusses the success and legacy of Tetris.",

        "synopsis": "A psychiatrist named Dr. Alan Fischer nervously moves around his office. After writing his will, he commits suicide by jumping off the building's roof.In a state penitentiary, Fischer's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, psychiatrist Dr. James Martin, arrives to interview a notorious serial killer and death-row inmate named Edward. Before meeting Edward, Martin meets Warden Tom Moss, revealing that Fischer had been evaluating Edward just before his suicide. Edward is scheduled to die by electrocution (the method he chose himself) that very day. Moss says Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis: if Martin declares Edward sane, he will be executed but if he is declared insane, as Fischer believed, Edward will be spared.Martin meets Edward who is confident and knows so much information about Martin that it leaves him at a loss. Edward insists he is not a human but a demon inhabiting Edward's body and named \"Nefariamus,\" a name Satan gave him- \"Nefarious\" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane, however he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also declares that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.Martin, an atheist balks at this idea which annoys Nefarious who calls him a \"pompous sack of meat\", believing that he is safe only because he thinks such things as demons don't exist. Martin plays along, asking Nefarious how he came to inhabit Edward. Nefarious explains that he began tempting Edward from a young age to commit small sins before communicating with him through a Ouija board Edward received for Christmas. Nefarious possessed Edward's body only after Edward consented to the possession multiple times. Martin brings in a chaplain to confront the demon in Edward, which frightens Nefarious until he realizes that the priest does not believe in demons and therefore has no effect on him. Martin then asks to talk to Edward, causing nefarious to recede and produce a timid, childlike Edward who is terribly distraught and shaken by his possession. Edward insists that he is possessed and that the demon had murdered multiple people using his innocent body as a vessel. When Martin begins probing further, Nefarious takes control and insists that martin murdered his mother.Shocked that Nefarious knows this, Martin insists that his mother was dying of a terminal illness and was euthanized after a difficult decision on his behalf. When Nefarious infers that Martin euthanized her to acquire her massive wealth, Martin becomes angry and threatens to leave the meeting. Nefarious explains he is mentally training Martin for an endeavor he wants Martin to do, and that he mentally tortured Stewart, driving him to take his own life so as to select Martin for this job. When Martin continues to be doubtful of Nefarious, the demon explains that he knows Martin's girlfriend is pregnant, and that because of Martin's threats to break up with her to avoid fatherhood, she is terminating her pregnancy.Nefarious explains that Martin can save his son with a simple phone call within the limited amount of time but Martin refuses, thinking Nefarious is bluffing, while also insisting that such a thing is his girlfriend's choice to make. However, overcome with curiosity, Martin begs a kindly prison guard for access to a phone, which he uses to call the Women's Health Clinic. Upon calling he realizes his girlfriend has just finished with the abortion. Nefarious cackles with glee, explaining to Martin that \"All Hell is rejoicing.\"A prison guard asks Edward what he wants for a final meal before execution to which Edward gives specific directions for a simple burger, fries, and milkshake, only to have Nefarious to resume control and tell the guard to retract the order.Martin is now interested in what Nefarious has to tell him. Nefarious explains the war in Heaven from his point of view, saying that the demons rebelled in order to avoid an eternity of slavery, and that they have been prospering in the world. He also explains that he chose death by electric chair because it was the most excruciating and painful death available and would be a \"parting gift\" before Edward's soul goes to Hell for an eternity of more torment.Martin insists that the world is reclaiming the moral high ground by allowing all kinds of rights and freedoms, which Nefarious laughs at before revealing to him the truth about such \"freedoms,\" including a decline in education and a resurgence of slavery and sex trafficking, which the demons help the elite to manage behind closed doors. Martin begins pitying Edward/Nefarious and almost writes him off as insane to which Nefarious tells him to redact. Martin is genuinely confused as to whom Nefarious is, until Edward breaks through, begging Martin to help him. However, before he can tell Martin how to help him, Nefarious takes control again and punishes Edward by breaking one of his fingers, then resetting it at Martin's insistence. Nefarious then explains the endeavor he wants Martin to do for him is to write a book called \"The Dark Gospel\" which is his Satanic equivalent to the Bible and will begin another world religion, this one in servitude to demons. Nefarious then lets Martin in on a closely guarded secret, that more people are currently going to Hell than to Heaven.Martin is called away by Warden Moss who reveals to him that upon searching Edward's prison cell, they found documentation of Martin's life as Nefarious had done with all his other victims, as well as \"The Dark Gospel\" which Edward already wrote, crediting it to Martin's name. Moss encourages Martin to condemn Edward, insisting that if he is spared, he will probably go after Martin. Martin, still believing Edward is faking, confronts Nefarious about the dossier on himself and manuscript. Nefarious breaks his hand to slip free of one of the handcuffs and seizes Martin, threatening to break his neck unless Martin begs him for life. Overcome with terror, Martin begs Nefarious to spare him to which Nefarious complies. He is beaten by the prison guards. In the heat of the moment, Martin declares that Edward is sane, but not before being warned by a triumphant Nefarious that he is condemning Edward to death.Edward's head is shaved and he is led to the electric chair. As Martin uneasily sits with the families of Nefarious' victims to witness the execution, he is complimented by the detective who spent six years pursuing Edward before capturing him. However, Martin is unsure of whether he made the right decision, remembering the \"three murders\" Nefarious told him he would commit which he surmises was his mother, his son, and now Edward. Before the execution, Edward pleads with Martin to tell the truth about the demonic possession, but Martin is unsure. Before the switch is pulled, Nefarious takes control of Edward's body for a final time, asking if Martin accepts his offer, to which Martin silently refuses. Disappointed, Nefarious quotes, \"Mene tekel upharsin,\" (\"You have been measured in the scale and found wanting\") before leaving Edward's body, causing Edward to suffer an extremely painful and terrible death in the chair.The demon then tells Martin, \"You should have accepted my offer,\" before possessing him. Martin, under Nefarious' influence grabs the detective's gun and holds the witnesses at gunpoint. Martin then realizes that the three murders he would commit that day were: his son, Edward, and now himself. Nefarious forces Martin to attempt suicide, but Martin spontaneously prays to God for help, and the gun misfires. Nefarious lets go of Martin as he faints into the arms of the guards.One year later, a visibly changed Martin is shown promoting Nefarious' book- not as a \"dark gospel\" but as a rewritten cautionary tale for people to read and realize the demonic influence in society. Despite insisting he is still an atheist, he reveals he has undergone many changes. On his way home, Martin sees a homeless woman rummaging through a dumpster. He gives her some money and she takes it before saying \"Hello James,\" in Nefarious' voice, implying that she is Nefarious' new host. The screen fades to black while Nefarious' hideous laughter is heard.",

        "synopsis": "Henry Sugar (Benedict Cumberbatch) is the pseudonym of a miserly bachelor who uses his inherited fortune to fund his gambling habits. Henry is 41 years old who inherited his fortune from his rich father. He was too selfish to share the fortune with anyone, hence never married. He had a taste for clothes, was tall, but not particularly handsome. He drove a Ferrari, which cost the same as a country cottage.\nHenry just wanted to make himself richer. Some buys stocks and share. Some buy art or diamonds. Some gamble. Henry was a gambler and not above cheating.Henry visited his friend William W and spent time at his library, which was filled with leather bound volumes of books from floor to ceiling. Henry notices a particular book in the collection, which looked out of place.He comes across a book of a doctor ZZ Chatterjee's (Dev Patel) 1935 report of Imdad Khan (Ben Kingsley), a man who claimed he could see and interact without using his eyes.\nImdad announced himself to Dr Chatterjee on 2nd Dec 1935, in Calcutta, and asked to be subjected to any manner of tests to validate his claim. Imdad was 61 years old, with white hair and a white mustache.\nImdad says that he travels with a circus and every time the circus visits a new town, He undergoes the same test at the biggest hospital of that town.\nChatterjee glues Imdad's eyelids and then covers it with dough and then bandages the entire face to make sure Imdad cannot see anything. Imdad walks confident out of the hospital and in to the streets. Imdad took a bicycle and rode away.After watching Imdad perform even greater feats in his own circus act, the doctor interviewed Imdad, and he tells him his life history. Imdad was born in Kashmir in 1873. In 1886, Imdad joined the circus and saved Rs 3000. As a young runaway in a traveling circus, he sought out a guru known as The Great Yogi (Richard Ayoade), who could meditate while levitating his own body. Imdad traveled to the town near the Ganges and hired a horse cart to travel to the jungle. His travelling companion turned out to be a disciple of the Yogi. The disciple disappeared once he learned that Imdad was seeking the Yogi, but Imdad had kept an eye on him and followed him through the jungle. Eventually, Imdad reaches a clearing with 2 huts in it.Imdad hid in a tree and saw the Yogi levitate with his own eyes. Imdad reveals himself to the Yogi. Yogi wanted to fling a brick at Imdad, but is immediately remorseful at his actions.\nReluctantly, he taught him his meditation method, which gained Imdad his abilities. Imdad was 17 years old when he started mediating. In 5 years, he was able to concentrate for 1.5 minutes. By 1907, when he was 34 years old. He could concentrate for 3 minutes without wandering his mind. By this time, he could start to visualize the outline of objects in front of him, without opening his eyes. For the next 8 years Imdad perfected his technique to read playing cards, charts and maps by keeping himself blindfolded. By 1915, he had perfected it.\nBut the public never believed him.Though Imdad died overnight before the doctors could further study him. Chatterjee saw Imdad as a medical miracle. Imdad could lead to blind gaining sight, or the deaf hearing. The possibilities were endless.\nChatterjee carefully recorded everything Imdad said and bound it into a book for safe keeping.By practicing Imdad's meditations for three years Henry manages to see through playing cards. Henry follows Imdad's instructions perfectly and makes much more rapid progress. He gradually reduces the time needed to read through cards from 1 minute to 5 seconds.\nHenry uses these abilities at a casino and makes \u00a330,000 at blackjack. Henry learns how to lose occasionally so as not to attract attention of the patrons.Henry got back home and suddenly realize that he did not want all this money that he had earned so easily. He could be the richest man in the world if he wanted.\nUnsatisfied with his ease in earning money, he throws them off his balcony into the streets of London. Since he nearly caused a riot, the police suggest that he find a more legal form of charity like giving it to an orphanage or a charity.He decides to travel worldwide, winning money with his abilities under varying disguises and to establishing a network of successful hospitals and orphanages. Within a year he had already won 120 million pounds. Henry accumulated all the money in Switzerland, which was tax free.\nTwo decades later, Henry dies at the age of 63 from a pulmonary embolism which he knew would cause his death. He had accumulated 644 million pounds. He had left behind 21 well established children's hospitals and orphanages all over the world. His accountant John Winston commissions Roald Dahl (Ralph Fiennes) to write on his story under the pseudonym Henry Sugar.\nRoald completed the story in 1976.",

        "synopsis": "From Wikipedia:\nIn 1970, eleven-year-old Margaret Simon is informed by her parents Barbara and Herb that the family is moving from New York City to a New Jersey suburb, as her father received a promotion. Margaret is upset about moving away from her friends and Sylvia, her beloved paternal grandmother. She begins to communicate with God about her concerns, anxieties, and hopes.Upon moving to New Jersey, Margaret is quickly befriended by her neighbor and soon-to-be classmate Nancy Wheeler. She welcomes her into her friend group that includes two other girls, Gretchen Potter and Janie Loomis. Margaret's teacher Mr. Benedict gives the class a year-long research assignment. When he learns Margaret dislikes religious holidays, she explains that since her mother is a Christian and her father is Jewish, her family does not observe the holidays and has left it up to Margaret to decide on her own religious identity as she grows older.Prompted by her school assignment, Margaret asks her mother why she has never met her maternal grandparents. Barbara reveals that she is estranged from her devoutly Christian parents Paul and Mary, who disowned her upon her marriage to a Jewish man. On a weekend visit to New York City, Margaret asks Sylvia to take her to temple, which Sylvia gladly does. Meanwhile, Barbara attempts to fit in with the PTA and signs up for multiple committees, which draws her away from her hobby of painting and teaching art.Margaret and her new friends anticipate the milestones of puberty, such as wearing a bra and having their first kisses. At a classmate's birthday party, Margaret enjoys her first kiss with Philip Leroy, a popular boy in her class, during a game of spin the bottle. After viewing a video about menstruation at school, the girls become excited about starting their periods. Margaret grows impatient when other girls get their periods before her, including Gretchen and Nancy. She and Janie buy sanitary pads at a drugstore to be prepared.One night while out with Nancy and her family in New York City, Margaret learns Nancy lied about getting her period earlier when she actually does get her period. At school, Margaret is assigned a group project with Laura Danker, a classmate who is ostracized by her peers (including Nancy) for being taller and more developed. While working together in the library, Margaret brings up rumors about Laura letting boys \"feel her up\", upsetting her and causing her to storm out. Margaret feels guilty for shaming her, while questioning her friendship with Nancy.For spring break, Margaret wants to visit Sylvia while she is vacationing in Florida, but these plans are interrupted when Paul and Mary reach out to Barbara and say they want to visit and meet Margaret. Upon learning of the cancellation, Sylvia decides to show up at the Simon house with a friend from Florida on the same day of Paul and Mary's visit.After dinner, when Paul and Mary question Margaret about possibly attending Sunday school, Sylvia retorts that Margaret went to temple with her and has already chosen to become Jewish, sparking an argument between the parents and grandparents. Margaret yells at the adults, proclaiming that she does not care about religion and does not even believe in God.Margaret hands in her research paper to Mr. Benedict, wherein she expresses her disillusionment with religion. Soon, she reconciles with her parents and Sylvia. At the end of the school year, Margaret thanks Mr. Benedict for being a good teacher. She also befriends Laura and asks her to dance, with Janie joining them shortly afterwards. Barbara, who has since returned to teaching painting, tells Nancy's mother Jan, the PTA president, that she will no longer volunteer for PTA committees.Just before leaving for summer camp, Margaret talks to Nancy's older brother Evan's friend Moose, a neighborhood boy who mows her family's lawn and whom she has a crush on, and the two agree to spend time together when she returns. At home, she discovers her first period has arrived and excitedly tells her mother. Margaret then resumes her communication with God.",

        "synopsis": "Scientist Richard Quinn is hunting down the chupacabra, a supposedly mythical creature, in San Javier to harness its alleged powers. Locating one with it baby in an old mine, he chases it. Injured by a passing vehicle, she leaves her baby hidden to lure the pursuing scientists away. Following the death of his father Beto from cancer, 13-year-old Alex flies to Mexico to meet his extended family for the first time, a trip his father had planned for them both. Alex meets his grandfather Chava, a former lucha libre champion, energetic wrestling-obsessed cousin Memo, and fearless hip cousin Luna. Just as Alex begins to get his bearings, on his first night he discovers a young chupacabra cub. He wakes to find it licking a cut on his hand. As Alex realizes they aren't positively regarded, he says nothing. A short time later, Luna drives Memo and Alex into town to search for Chava. She explains that he often wanders off (he may have Alzheimer's disease). In the market Alex sees a miniature colorful figure, which the seller tells him is a chupacabra, which he says is not such a bad creature. Back on the road, the kids find Chava walking with a goat. He bought it but can't explain why. On their return to the ranch, they come across some men carefully searching an area where Quinn finds evidence of what he believes is of the chupacabra. At the ranch house, they watch yet another news report on the feared full-grown chupacabra, fabled to feed on livestock. Chava turns off the TV, saying it's nonsense and lies. Once he goes out, Alex tells Luna that their grandfather is hiding something. He shows her a small music box he found him playing in the barn. She chalks it up to more evidence of his suspected Alzeimer's. Alex plays the music box in the doorway of the barn later. Hearing a mix of cooing and other sounds, he turns to see a strange creature. A mix between a mammal and a bird, furry but with wings the size of a small dog, Alex gets it a plate of sausages from the house to see if it's hungry. When a thunder storm rolls through, he promises to protect it. Alex wakes to Memo looking for him. He tries to usher him out of the barn, but the young chupacabra presents himself as Alex befriended him. He has just gotten Memo calmed down when Luna shows up. Also initially screaming, they show her he's friendly. Luna thinks they should put him out, but Alex insists they need to protect it as if it's a baby. Chava comes in, agreeing with Alex. Chupa, as Alex has named it, approaches him. Chava explains that he'd accidentally hit its parent with his car some nights ago and had found it hiding nearby. He is keeping it a secret as he knows people are looking to exploit it. Returning to the house, Quinn introduces himself, explaining he's from an American government agency which seeks rare species for medical purposes. Finding a license plate from the crash site, he's traced it to him. Chava refuses to let him snoop around, offering to demonstrate a lucha libre move if he doesn't leave. After Alex promises Chupa he will find his family, Memo comes to teach it to fly. Taking it to the barn roof, Memo fearlessly 'flies' into a haystack below. Encouraging it to follow, Chupa gets the wings to work a bit before also falling into the hay. In the house, Chava shows Alex a video of El Perico Verde doing his signature move Suplex, which he had taught him himself. He reveals that Beto was the fighter, but never became professional because he met Alex's mother and moved to the States. Once Chava talks about Beto enough to sadden Alex, he pulls out his Game Boy. He recognizes it's his way of avoiding his feelings. Taking the video console, Chava tells Alex he must fight him for it. Having learned that his new friend Chupa has a secret history with his family and is being hunted by the determined Quinn to try and harness his powers, the family sets off on the adventure of a lifetime to protect Chupa from impending danger.",
        "plot": "While visiting family in Mexico, teenage Alex gains an unlikely companion when he discovers a young chupacabra hiding in his grandpa's shed. To save the mythical creature, Alex and his cousins must embark on the adventure of a lifetime."

        "synopsis": "In an archive video, a young June Allen is with her deceased father James, who died from a brain tumor shortly after the video was made. Years later, June's mother Grace leaves for a week-long trip to Cartagena, Colombia, with her boyfriend Kevin, leaving June in the care of Grace's friend Heather, a divorce lawyer who expresses some jealousy at Grace's relationship with Kevin.A week later, June is tasked with retrieving her mother and Kevin from Los Angeles International Airport, but they never arrive. June contacts the FBI, but later decides to investigate herself using an array of digital tools at her disposal. She also hires Javier, a Colombian gig worker who complies with June's requests for a small fee.Upon hacking into Kevin's Gmail account, June discovers a number of aliases and a criminal record of scamming many women for their money. Believing Kevin to have kidnapped her mother, June has Javier look for clues as to their whereabouts in Colombia. She traces Kevin's past movements to a location in Nevada, where she talks to Jimmy, a man claiming to be a pastor at a Christian rehabilitation center for ex-convicts. He tells her that Kevin has been rehabilitated and is genuinely in love with Grace. June eventually accesses her mother's online dating profile, where past messages reveal that her mother was already aware of Kevin's past.FBI agent Elijah Park informs June that he received footage of a band of criminals seemingly kidnapping Kevin and Grace in Colombia. June uncovers this as a fabricated event, as Kevin had hired a lookalike actress named Rachel Page to impersonate her mother, who had been kidnapped en route to the airport beforehand. As the case makes national headlines, Rachel confesses she was unaware of Kevin's intentions when she accompanied him to Colombia. It revealed that Grace has had multiple aliases as well, sparking speculation that she had something to do with her own disappearance. Swearing by her mother's innocence, June's suspicions fall on Heather when she discovers an encrypted line of communication between her and Kevin. June sneaks into Heather's office but finds it ransacked and with files deleted. She then discovers Heather's corpse in a storage closet.Later, June views live footage of a police raid in Colombia focusing on Kevin, who is shot and killed despite surrendering.

She finds a threatening e-mail directed at Grace, which leads her to discover security cameras that Kevin bought to install at an abandoned house, which happens to be her old vacation home in Nevada. Just then, Jimmy calls June and indicates he has some information about Grace.Jimmy arrives and reveals that he is June's father and that Grace was emotionally unstable and took June away from him after having him arrested under false charges. However, he also unwittingly reveals himself as a domestic abuser whose drug habit endangered all of them; Grace and Heather had told June he died of cancer to shield her from the truth. James sought revenge by enlisting Kevin, whom he met in prison, to pose as a prospective boyfriend so he could find Grace and June.James kidnaps June and takes her to the old house, where Grace is also detained. They reunite before Grace is shot by James. James tries to leave with June, but Grace fatally stabs him in the neck with a shard of broken glass.

        "synopsis": "Former male stripper Mike Lane, who lost his furniture business during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now in his forties, still in Miami and a bartender for a catering company. At Maxandra \"Max\" Mendoza's fund-raising event, Mike is recognized by Kim, a lawyer for Max's foundation. Afterward, Mike is asked to speak with Max privately. Alone, Max says Kim told her about his prowess and asks how much for a lap dance. Mike says he is retired, but ultimately says $60,000 when pushed. Max says $6,000 with no 'happy ending', but during the dance she and Mike give in to passion and sleep together. The next morning, Mike refuses the $6,000, but Max offers him the $60,000 to go to London and the United Kingdom for a month. Mike agrees but only as her boyfriend. She accepts and they travel to London together. Max's ex-husband Roger gave her the Rattigan Theatre in their divorce settlement, and she announces the theatrical production presently in place of the play Isabel Ascende will be halted for one month so Mike Lane can choreograph a special dance production. As Mike and Max discuss the logistics of this show she has come up with, her teenage daughter Zadie arrives. Distrustful of him, she explains that her mother tries to reinvent herself every few years. Auditions for potential dancers are soon underway. An actress from the original show Isabel Ascende shows up, wanting to participate. This inspires them to rethink the new show with elements of the original, so they cast her. Going to dinner with a few of Max's London contacts, Mike feels out of his element. Later on, in the car, when Max moves toward physical intimacy with him and he pulls back, it upsets her. The next day in rehearsal, she is excessively critical of his choreography. Max and Mike build a temporary extension of the stage, so the show has a much more palpable feel, the City of Westminster threatens sanctions due to alterations to the historical building without prior approval. They persuade the only woman on the board, Edna Eaglebauer, to support the show. As she lives a quiet life alone, they fill her morning bus with the men from the show. Edna gets her own sample, as the 10 men do a flirty, choreographed number just for her benefit. She gives them her seal of approval. Mike and Max argue about the ending of the show. She wants him to personalize it and it finishes with a happy finish. She also would really like him to dance in it, but he reiterates he is retired and will not go on stage. The show gets shut down again, so Max confronts Roger. He reminds her that their separation agreement includes a clause that she does not tarnish his family name. After Max tells Mike to return to the United States, he gets the keys to the theater through Victor and rehearsals resume secretly. The show is not open to the public, but rather by invitation only, as Zadie taps into her mother's contacts. Sunday evening arrives, and Victor and Zadie drag Max out for the show she believed she had shut down, even Roger is invited. The opening act starts the same as Isabel Ascende, but the protagonist is offered only two possible life choices, marry the rich aristocrat or the poor one with a heart of gold. So, she calls her imaginary friend from her childhood, the unicorn, breaks the fourth wall and then talks about modern feminist ideas about what choices women should be afforded, using a golden mic that drops from above. Then Isabel's male counterparts strip off their formal attire and the other dancers are presented one by one. They have sexier and sexier numbers until the last few, Victor is asked to remove Zadie for the most \"adult\". After a lap dance number for three of the more mature audience members, Mike's number with a professional dancer is reminiscent of moments shared between him and Max. Once the show is over, Mike finds Max, they kiss, and he says he loves her.",
        "plot": "Mike takes to the stage again, following a business deal that went bust, leaving him broke and taking bartender gigs in Florida. Mike heads to London with a wealthy socialite who lures him with an offer he can't refuse."

        "synopsis": "In the late 1960s and 70s, Jos\u00e9 (Michael Pe\u00f1a) is a young boy whose family (Father Salvador Hernandez (Julio Cesar Cedillo), Brother Beto, mother Julia (Ver\u00f3nica Falc\u00f3n) and sister Lety) travels from Michoac\u00e1n as migrant workers picking grapes in California, his parents hoping to buy a house back home after they've made enough money. While they are working in the harvest season, Jos\u00e9 attends school and works in the fields with his family after.\nHis teacher, Ms. Young (Michelle Krusiec), notices his potential and visits his parents at home to express her concern over the disruption to his studies by going back and forth as migrant workers.\nJose says that he wants to be an astronaut after he watches he 1969 moon landings on TV.\nAfter his father is only paid partial wages for his work, he realizes Jos\u00e9's teacher was right to be concerned and the family decides to stay in California full time.Years later in 1985, Jos\u00e9 graduates from the University of the Pacific and is hired as an engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab is working on the most sophisticated laser weapon in the world to protect the USA from incoming ballistic nuclear missiles.Salvador never stops reminding Jose how much the whole family has sacrificed for him.\nJose has to bear racial stereotyping at work when he is assumed to be the new janitor by the lab staff. Beto still works in the fields. He is then given menial tasks such as photocopying thousands of documents. Weissberg (Jordan Dean) is Jose's colleague.\nJose has already started applying to NASA and his application has been rejected.Feeling as if he needs to fit in better, he trades in his customized 1963 Chevrolet Impala for a used Mazda RX-7.\nWhile signing the paperwork for the new car, he meets Adela (Rosa Salazar), whom he asks out. After an intimidating first meeting with her family (Adela has a large family and her father insists that he would have to be present for all visits), they see each other more until they marry. They have five kids.\nAdela laughs at Jose's goal of wanting to be an astronaut.\nJose finds major flaw in the laser design while photocopying the documents. He brings it to the notice of his supervisor that the Beryllium detector in the laser cannot differentiate between the heat from the laser and the heat from an explosion, hence giving spurious readings.\nJos\u00e9 continues to work successfully at the lab, now instructing the researchers, including Weissberg, who had previously ignored him.By now Jose has been rejected by NASA 6 times. Adela realizes that Jose is serious about his astronaut dream. She wants him to do what it takes to get selected. Jose says that the last batch of astronauts had 12,962 applicants. The selected batch had many pilots, & high-performance athletes.\nJose trains himself to be a pilot and works on his fitness. He starts diving training, as one of selected had logged more than 700 dives. Many of them speak Russian.\nAfter several years Jose is able to gain proficiency in many of the skills needed for the program.One day during class, Jos\u00e9's boss Clint Logan (Eric Johnson) offers him a chance to join a team going to Russia to evaluate a shipment of enriched uranium the United States is looking to purchase for NASA, noting that a trip like that would look really good on an application to the NASA space program. In 1999, Jose travels to Russia and stays there for 6 months.\nAfter several rejections, Jos\u00e9 hand delivers his 12th application in person to Frederick Sturckow (Garret Dillahunt) who trains incoming astronauts and is a veteran of the Space Shuttle program. He makes a positive impression on Sturckow and is accepted into the program shortly thereafter.Jos\u00e9 struggles with the training, falling further behind the rest of his class. When he learns of Beto's (Bobby Soto) death in a gang-based shoot-out, he loses focus and is exhorted by Sturckow to catch up with the rest or he may be dismissed from the program. He later has a conversation with the head trainer, Kalpana Chawla (Sarayu Blue), who describes to him why going to space makes all of their hard work worthwhile, and ends by letting him know she's been selected as the Mission Specialist for STS-107 on Space Shuttle Columbia.As Jos\u00e9 sits with his family watching the broadcast of Columbia's re-entry, they are shaken when news comes in that Columbia didn't survive. Nevertheless, Jos\u00e9 continues on and begins excelling among his classmates at NASA.\nJose hires a commercial property as location for Adela's Mexican restaurant.In 2008, Sturckow pulls Jos\u00e9 into a conference room to meet with the selection team, who informs him that he's been chosen to join STS-128 as their Mission Specialist. Jos\u00e9 visits Adela's restaurant outside the NASA grounds and tells her the news, with his family later watching him at the press conference. He quotes Beto's words to him that it's fitting for a migrant farm-worker to go into the unknowns of space. As he enters quarantine in preparation for the mission, Adela visits him with a surprise: his former teacher Ms. Young, who tells him she's been waiting for this moment for over 30 years, having followed his progress and career, always believing in his enormous potential.The launch day finally arrives, Jos\u00e9 is prepared along with the rest of the crew who board the shuttle and launch into orbit. After main engine cutoff, Jos\u00e9 looks around at the shuttle cabin and imagines seeing the same Monarch Butterfly that landed on his dad's arm the day their family decided to stay in California, hinting that he had achieved his destiny.Closing titles note that Mission STS 128 remained on board the International Space Station for 13 days, and that Jos\u00e9 had tacos and listened to Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez's \"El Hijo Del Pueblo\" while there. Jos\u00e9 was the first migrant farm-worker in space, and still picks grapes with his father today, albeit in his own vineyard: Tierra Luna Cellars in Lodi, California.",

        "synopsis": "Jack Kelly, Connor Brody and Mike Richards have been friends and colleagues for decades. Now in their 50s, they struggle with the modern world and how they are expected to behave. For example, when Connor tries to get his son Colin (Dominic Grey Gonzalez) to apologize for hitting, his wife Cara reprimands him. Deciding to sell their business Trifecta to some millennials, but kept on as employees, they are shocked when the hipster new boss Aspen fires everyone over 35 except them. Moving away from simply selling throwback team jerseys, the company is modernizing, becoming both gender- and carbon-neutral.Jack gets publicly chewed out by the director of his son Nate's pre-school for being two minutes late and responds with the coarsest of vulgarities. His wife, Leah, forces him to apologize, as a recommendation will be needed from her for private kindergarten admission, and she points out he has anger management issues. When Jack and Leah go to the school to apologize to the director, she makes him do it to the group of parents and kids. A few pinpoint the specifics that upset them, he apologizes for each. However, Leah points out Jack must continue to be on his best behavior for the next three months so the director gives Nate a recommendation.Meanwhile, divorc\u00e9 and father of two adult sons Mike arrives home to a surprise. Although he had had a vasectomy, his young girlfriend Britney divulges that she is pregnant. Later, the three friends meet at the bar and Jack and Connor try to get him to look on the bright side.As Jack has been asked to organize the school fundraiser, he and Connor are made to feel marginalized by the millennials. Then, the three friends are sent to find Ed Cameron, a man who has chosen to be off-grid since the 1980s, to convince him to represent the company. Travis (Justin Miles), one of the young employees, accompanies them. As the old friends banter, he calls them misogynistic. Mike calls him out for his superior attitude, proving through his love of modern music that he is not always politically correct either. When they hit an armadillo, Ed comes to collect it.Meanwhile, Leah comes across Cara. Colin walks up and hits her pregnant stomach. When she warns him, he blatantly punches it. Cara defends him and the women argue. At Trifecta, although the trio were successful recruiting Cameron, Aspen fires them as a hidden camera in the rental car caught their misogynistic banter. Even Travis is sacked, as his TV camera captured him singing strongly worded rap lyrics as he started his day.Afterwards, Mike cuts off ties with Jack; Connor is not allowed to have contact because of Cara's anger at the Kellys, so Jack focuses on the school fundraiser. Everything goes well until he has another blow up, resulting in Leah kicking him out. Jack and Mike coincide in a late-night eatery. They make peace, then pick up Connor for a casino bachelor party road-trip, as Britney insists they marry. They come across Aspen, who has been fired for accidentally using politically incorrect jargon and dumped. Later, at a strip club, Jack gets a call that Leah is in labor. Drunk, they are forced to get an Uber. Excruciatingly slow, they end up grabbing small electric scooters to complete the journey.Missing the birth, Jack still makes up with Leah and vows to go to therapy. In the end, they opt for public school for Nate and Jack has learned to control his temper. Mike proposes to Britney properly and Connor gets Cara to lighten up.",

        "synopsis": "Will Grady finds his girlfriend Summer Elswick brutally murdered in a rural Maine house that they had been showing for sale as realtors. When questioned by the police detectives assigned to the case, Tom Nichols and his partner Dan Cleary, Will reveals that he was planning on marrying Summer but could not because she was technically still married to Sam Gifford. He is released. Video evidence from nearby security footage shows a dark-colored car with a missing hubcap that Dan identifies as a 1990 Buick LeSabre; later on, Tom's wife Judy correctly identifies the vehicle as a Chrysler Imperial.After Summer's funeral, Will tells Tom about a man named Eli Phillips who had come to his mother's house a few nights earlier and tried to force himself in. He explains that, when his father ran the family's real estate company, they had forcibly bought Eli's family farm. Eli's father committed suicide, and he blames Will's family for it. When Tom and Dan question Eli, Eli accuses Will of murdering Summer. He also reveals that he has been researching information on Tom himself, showing an awareness of a corruption scandal involving his former partner when he was working at a precinct in Philadelphia.DNA analysis of semen found inside of Summer during the autopsy matches that of Sam. This goes along with a statement from a friend of Summer's that the two of them were still seeing each other, meeting secretly at the properties she was selling to have sex. Tom returns to Sam's with a warrant. Sam grabs Dan's gun and is shot by Tom while attempting to flee. A search of his house finds 13 kilograms of heroin.The deceased Sam is declared to be Summer's murderer, but Tom is hesitant to consider the case solved. Eli shows up at his house at night and gives him a flash drive with evidence that Summer was caught up in a scheme by the Gradys to launder drug money. Properties are planted with drugs and then commandeered via civil asset forfeiture. The Gradys, operating under a shell company called White Fish, then snap up the properties at a discount. Summer was murdered to stop her from reporting the scheme to the DEA.Evidence points to police officer Wally Finn being behind White Fish, as he also heads a private security company called Active Duty Consulting that uses the same post office box as White Fish. Will shows up at Eli's house demanding the flash drive back. Another person shows up. Tom later arrives at Eli's house and finds him missing.At the birthday party for Captain Robert Allen, Tom's superior officer and Judy's uncle, Tom attempts to privately inform Allen of Wally's role in Summer's murder and the money laundering scheme, but is interrupted. Later at the same party, Tom discovers a Chrysler Imperial in Allen's garage with a recent paint job. Allen finds Tom in his garage and tells him to let the matter go.Fearing for his safety, Tom comes home with Judy, explains what he knows to her, and tells her that they must leave that night. However, Allen calls and says he will explain the matter the next day if Tom comes over. Tom agrees. He gives the flash drive to police chief Marty Graeber, and the two of them go together to Allen's house. Marty excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and Allen pleads with Tom to leave to save his life, before going upstairs. Allen is then shot. Marty, who is in on the scheme, reaches for his gun but Tom shoots first and kills Marty. He then shoots Wally (who was the man upstairs who killed Allen) and subdues him.The FBI arrests Will as he is golfing.",

After running out of money while partying in Sydney, they take up an employment agency's offer to work as bartenders at the Royal Hotel, a pub in a remote Outback mining town. Upon arrival, they meet the pub's owner Billy and his wife Carol, who also works as the pub's chef. Hanna and Liv's first shift is handling the raucous farewell party for their predecessors, English tourists Jules and Cassie. While working, they meet several of the regulars. Hanna is disturbed by the casual sexism, misogynistic jokes, and inappropriate behaviour displayed by the pub patrons, who are mostly men, although Liv brushes it off as a culture shock.The next day, Jules and Cassie are driven back to town by a mysterious local named Dolly. Matty, a young regular at the pub who flirted with Hanna and Liv the previous night, pays them a visit and the group goes swimming nearby; Hanna begins to bond with Matty. Returning, they observe Billy and Carol's unstable relationship and learn that Billy has not paid deliveryman Tommy for the last three months, much to Carol's chagrin. That night at the girls' upstairs living quarters, while Liv is asleep, Hanna rebuffs Matty's attempts to have sex, before ordering him to leave. In the morning, Matty apologises to Hanna. Over the next few nights, Hanna continues to endure harassment and microaggressions by the pub patrons, while Liv is embraced by the regulars for her easygoing attitude.Liv begins to slack off at work and joins the regulars in drinking, striking up a friendship with local miner Teeth. During one quiet night, after an intoxicated Liv retires early and leaves Hanna to work alone, a drunk and aggressive Dolly antagonises Hanna and a few patrons before he is finally forced to leave by Billy. Hanna is rattled by the incident, but Liv believes Dolly to be harmless. Shortly afterwards, when a snake invades the girls' living quarters, Dolly offers to retrieve it. The next morning, Hanna discovers Dolly has left the dead snake in a jar of alcohol with her name on it, further upsetting her, but Liv once again dismisses Hanna's concerns.After unsuccessfully attempting to get Dolly banned from the pub, Hanna announces that she and Liv are quitting, but Billy refuses to pay them. During an argument with Carol over paying Tommy and the girls, Billy injures himself in a drunken fall, forcing Carol to drive him to the nearest hospital. Before leaving, Carol reveals she has taken most of the money to pay Tommy and has left some for Hanna and Liv. She instructs the pair to make as much money as they can and then leave when the next bus arrives in two days.On their last night at the pub, Hanna throws a birthday party for Liv. Learning from Teeth that Liv has left with Dolly, Hanna soon finds her drunk in Dolly's car. When Dolly attempts to drive off, Hanna intervenes by slashing one of the tyres of his car with an axe. Hanna and Liv return to the pub where they argue. The next morning, Hanna awakens to let Matty in, only to discover Dolly is with him. The two men break in and chase Hanna to her living quarters. Liv leaves with Dolly while an agitated Hanna attempts to ward off Matty with the axe. A scuffle ensues and Hanna is injured.As Dolly and Matty take Liv to their car, Hanna steps outside. Alarmed at her friend's injuries, Liv breaks free from Dolly and reunites with Hanna. As Dolly approaches, Teeth smashes into his car with his truck and proceeds to assault Dolly as Matty flees. Retreating to the pub, the girls begin to break several bottles. When Teeth walks in, declaring that he beat up Dolly to claim Liv for himself, Liv angrily turns him away. With the pub covered in liquor, Hanna sets the building on fire. Hanna and Liv walk away in silence as the Royal Hotel burns",

        "synopsis": "From Wikipedia:In Waterloo, 1996, Research in Motion (RIM) CEO Mike Lazaridis and his best friend and co-founder Douglas Fregin prepare to pitch their \"PocketLink\" cellular device to businessman Jim Balsillie. Lazaridis is bothered by the buzzing of Balsillie's China-manufactured intercom and fixes it before he arrives. Their pitch is unsuccessful, but after Balsillie is fired from his job, he agrees to work with them if he is made CEO of RIM and given one third of the company. They hesitate, but after discovering that their deal with USRobotics was a malicious attempt to bankrupt them, they bring Balsillie in as co-CEO and give him a third of RIM.Balsillie arranges a pitch for the PocketLink with Bell Atlantic and forces Fregin and Lazaridis to build a crude prototype overnight, which he and Lazaridis take to New York. Lazaridis forgets the prototype in their taxi, leaving Balsillie to attempt the pitch alone. Lazaridis recovers the prototype at the last second and finishes the pitch, and they rebrand the PocketLink as the \"BlackBerry\".In 2003, Palm CEO Carl Yankowski plans a hostile takeover of the immensely successful RIM, forcing Balsillie to try to raise RIM's stockprice by selling an amount of phones that exceed Bell Atlantic's (now Verizon Communications) network limit behind Lazaridis's back. This crashes the network, so Balsillie poaches engineers from around the world to fix the problem, as well as hiring a man named Charles Purdy as RIM's COO to keep the engineers in line, though this upsets Fregin, who values the casual and fun work environment he and Lazaridis had created. The new engineers fix the network issue under Purdy's strict management, and RIM avoids Yankowski's buyout.In 2007, RIM's upcoming pitch of the BlackBerry Bold to Verizon is thrown into chaos when Steve Jobs announces the iPhone. Balsillie, a lifelong hockey fan, is occupied with trying to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins, forcing Lazaridis to pitch the Bold with Fregin instead. When it goes poorly, he panics and impulsively promises them the \"Storm\", a BlackBerry with a touchscreen. As he finally agrees with Purdy's suggestion to outsource the labor of the Storm to China, he insults Fregin during an argument. Fregin later quits RIM as a result.Balsillie becomes nervous when he sees the iPhone's projected sales and tries to arrange a meeting with AT&T's CEO, only to learn that the Penguins sale is being finalized that day. He chooses the Penguins, but they reject his offer after revealing they know of his plan to move the Penguins to Hamilton, which they learned of when Balsillie mockingly invited Yankowski to a Hamilton game and he informed the NHL. The SEC raids RIM after learning that Balsillie hired the engineers in 2003 with illegally backdated stock options, threatening Lazaridis with legal action. Balsillie arrives too late to meet with the CEO, who snubs Balsillie by hinting that AT&T's partnership with Apple is predicated on the fact that data usage has superseded phone minutes as a priority. Balsillie returns to RIM to find that Lazaridis sold him out to the SEC, leaving Lazaridis as the sole CEO of RIM.One year later, the Storms arrive from China, but Lazaridis finds them to be laden with bugs and can hear buzzing when he holds one to his ear. As he begins manually fixing the buzzing phones one by one, the closing titles reveal that the Storms were almost universally inoperable and Verizon sued RIM to cover the financial loss, Lazaridis resigned as CEO in 2012, Balsillie avoided jail, Fregin sold his stock in 2007, making him one of the richest men in the world. At the height of its success, the BlackBerry phone made up 45% of the cell phone market and is now 0% in the present day, with BlackBerry phones no longer being produced.",

        "synopsis": "In 2011, Liza Drake (Emily Blunt ) is a struggling single mother working as an exotic dancer in Florida while raising her teenage daughter Phoebe (Chloe Coleman) and dealing with Phoebe's father who lives in Savannah. After meeting Pete Brenner (Chris Evans) at her club and having a friendly and casual conversation, he offers her a job paying $100,000 per year. Later, Liza is called into her daughter's school when her daughter and her friends are suspended for starting a fire near the campus. Liza takes Phoebe and her niece home, where she's living out of her sister's garage. After an argument about money her sister kicks her out and Liza and Phoebe move into a motel.\nLiza meets Camile and Sydney at the motel.After her car is repossessed, Liza decides to take Pete up on his job offer and tracks him down to his office at pharmaceutical company Zanna. She is unaware that the cash-strapped start-up is having a hard time breaking into the market and is desperately scrambling for additional investors to fund a marketing push in the run-up to its planned IPO.\nZanna's cancer pain relief medication has a market penetration of less than 1%, but Pete says it takes only 5 minutes to kick in and is not addictive like other pain medications in the market. Eric Paley is the CEO and believes that with a penetration of 22%, Zanna will be a $1 Billion valuation company. Larkin is the VP of Marketing.\nPete looks at Liza's dismal resume and forges a more impressive curricula vitae, claiming she has a bachelor's degree in biochemistry. He then takes her to meet the founder of the company, Doctor Jack Neel (Andy Garc\u00eda), who hires her immediately despite the company being on an apparent hiring freeze. Pete gives her a five-day probation to convince a major physician to prescribe their marquee drug, Lonafen.\nPete tells Liza that she can $40,000 per month on a full dose sale for one patient. Dr. Lydell is a doctor who has prescribed over $9 million worth of pain medications for the competition in the last 12 months alone.Liza goes through the entire list of potential clients in fewer than five days and fails to secure any prescriptions. Meanwhile, Phoebe experiences a seizure, and they learn she has CAVM. Thinking the job opportunity is over, she returns to the office of Dr. Lydell (Brian d'Arcy James), her first sales attempt to collect a piece of Tupperware she left with him and overhears a cancer patient and his wife discussing the poor side effects he's experiencing from a more commonly prescribed drug. After making a convincing and transparent case that Lonafen would be a better option for his patient, Lydell agrees to prescribe it.Liza also invites him to help launch their speaker program wherein he can share his testimony about the drug's efficacy as a physician. But speaker programs require the company to pick up the expenses for the doctor to fly around to exotic locations and Zanna did not have the money. Larkin refuses to fund it, so Liza convinces Pete to fund it out of pocket and in exchange take the 10-point commission on Lydell sales directly, without going through the company.\nThe event initially fails (as the whole thing was severely underfunded and nobody showed up), and Lydell nearly ends his relationship with Zanna despite his patient praising the drug, but Liza is able to salvage the situation and turn it into a proper speaker program. When Pete offers Lydell financial incentives ($4500 per week) to prescribe Lonafen, Lydell officially signs on.A few days later Pete shows Liza that Lydell has been prescribing Lonafen as often as he can (he switches 40 patients in 3 days). Liza makes $600K in the first year.\nAfter her success with Lydell, a flood of new recruits arrives hoping to join Zanna as sales reps. Liza signs her mother Jackie on as a sales rep as well. The reps that Liza and Pete hired were Poor, Hungry and Desperate. None of them came from the Pharma background.\nAfter sending the team out into the field, Zanna rises to take 86% of the market share in the southeast.Larkin (Jay Duplass) tries to expose Liza as a fraud for her resume that Pete doctored. This backfires and angers Neel who promotes Liza to National Sales Director and Pete to COO, the latter of whom immediately fires Larkin. Zanna launches the IPO and gives a 400% gain in 3 days.\nAs Zanna continues to rake in profits, they move into a larger headquarters and Neel's eccentricities begin to manifest more clearly.\nDuring an executive meeting CEO Eric Paley (Amit Shah) makes suspicious comments, provoking Pete to aggressively frisk him where he finds his smartphone is recording the meeting. Paley claims he's just recording it as an insurance policy in case the company runs into legal trouble. Paley is fired but cashes in on his company shares and earns millions.\nLiza has $6 million in stock options but cannot sell the stock as they have 6 months still to vest.\nNeel grows angry and impatient when sales begin to flatten out, and pressures Liza and the sales team to push the drug off-label, marketing it for all types of pain, not just cancer (But the drug in only approved for use against cancer pain). He also instructs Liza to fire her mother Jackie (Catherine O'Hara), after he slept with her following a speaker program, whom Liza hired as a representative with the initial group.Liza approaches Lydell with her new marching orders and is disappointed when he readily agrees to prescribe Lonafen off-label. Meanwhile, Phoebe experiences another seizure during a school rehearsal, and the doctor tells her about the arterial mass in Phoebe's brain has grown and she needs to have the surgery to have it removed.\nLiza attempts to offer her stock options in Zanna as collateral for a loan that will pay for Phoebe's surgery, but the bank denies her because of the volatility in the pharmaceutical industry. After Lydell is arrested in a DEA sting operation, Liza believes Zanna is finished as a company, and in desperation approaches Neel for financial help paying for the surgery. Neel instead exhorts her to use the crisis of Phoebe's situation as \"fire\" for inspiration, like he did when his wife was dying from cancer, and he came up with Lonafen.After her friend Camille's husband Sidney dies from an overdose on Lonafen and Camille coldly rejects Liza's condolences, Liza decides to testify to the U.S. Attorney's office that's investigating Zanna. She admits that she helped build Zanna's speaker program and worked to bring their bribery program into compliance. When asked who else signed off on those programs she confirms the names given to her: Eric Paley, Pete Brenner, and Jack Neel. She's told testimony won't be enough and they ask for greater proof linking Neel to the criminal activity, which Liza explains is nearly impossible because Neel has insulated himself from the daily operations.At the next speaker program Liza attempts to steal a printout from Pete's jacket but he catches her in the parking lot before she can leave and finds the printout in her purse. Pete is implicated and arrested, though Neel offers to take care of his family and assets while he's in prison. The FBI also catch up to Eric Paley and arrest him. While all of his executives were being arrested, Neel remained untouchable.\nLiza recalls her mom's earlier affair with Neel and asks how she corresponded with him. Jackie says he didn't give out his phone but gave her his email which she used to make her request for a commission increase that Neel wanted her fired for. Liza finds that Jackie had saved the emails and they served as the link between Neel and the illegal activities at Zanna.In the U.S. Attorney's depositions, experts reveal that Lonafen is just Fentanyl which is why non-terminal patients who were prescribed the drug became addicted and often died from overdose.\nLydell (40 months), Paley (16 months), Brenner (36 months), and Neel (66 months) all received fines and prison sentences. After a heartfelt apology given in court, and the U.S. Attorney's recommendation that Liza not serve a prison sentence in order not to discourage future whistle-blowers, the judge still sentences Liza to 16 months in prison, stating that her greed cost lives.Fifteen months later Liza has been released early and has partnered with her mother and some of the original sales representatives from Zanna to form the cosmetics company that she and Jackie had envisioned when Liza was still living in her sister's garage. Liza considers that she almost never thinks about her former career with Zanna, except when she can't sleep. She'll dream about running Zanna as the CEO and saving it from the corruption that became its downfall, but she quickly abandons those thoughts because they scare her.",

        "synopsis": "Wealthy trader and serial killer David Robey (Andy Serkis) blackmails and kidnaps cleaner Callum Aldrich. DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) is assigned to the case and promises Callum's mother, Corinne (Hattie Morahan), he will find her son. Concerned about his involvement, Robey digs up dirt on the various illegal acts Luther has committed as a police officer (he comes across as a vigilante who takes law into his own hands and feels that the rules don't apply to him), resulting in him being fired, prosecuted and imprisoned.Years later, Robey coaxes Corrine and the parents of other victims to a house (he had kept them alive all these years) where he burns their children's corpses (the parents finds their kids hanging in the basement when they arrive at the house. A overheated mobile phone battery triggers a fire). The house belonged to a Saudi national, who hadn't set foot in Britain for several years.\nCorrine visits Luther in prison, admonishing him for not finding her son's killer. Robey sends a recording of him murdering Callum to Luther in prison via a radio frequency (which was passed on to Luther in prison, via a note under his door). In a twist, it was Robey who drove Corrine to prison, as nobody still knows that Robey is behind the kidnappings and the murders. Robey has positioned himself as sympathetic to all the parents who lost their kids to the serial killer.\nLuther informs DCI Odette Raine (Cynthia Erivo) over phone, the new head of Serious and Serial Crime, of the broadcast. Raine tells him that the killer sent the recordings to the families of all the 8 victims. Luther knows something big is coming and the killer is looking for an audience. Luther wants to be one step ahead of the killer. Raine tells Luther that she doesn't care about a dirty cops unfinished business and refuses to help him in any way.\nHe liaises with prison guards and former associate McCabe (Vincent Regan) to break him out of prison. Luther bribes the guards to let the other prisoners attack him (they hate Luther as he was a cop). This then becomes an excuse for the guards to transfer Luther to another prison, and for McCabe to break him out, en-route.Raine brings in retired DSU Martin Schenk (Dermot Crowley) as a consultant to help track down Luther. Schenk used to be Luther's boss. Raine promises to kill Luther, if he messes with her investigation. Luther finds the radio station that is broadcasting Robey's radio message. From the owner of the radio station Derek, he learns that the owner met a man online, who was into extreme submission porn. Derek was give an address and security codes for a meeting. Derek reached the place and found a man waiting for him, and proceeded to have sex with him. Derek later realized that this wasn't the man he met online, and that he had just raped a complete stranger. He then received blackmail threats and was told to play the broadcast tape without asking any questions. Luther takes the phone on which Derek is contacted.\nLuther contacts SChenk and asks him to trace the number. Schenk keeps Raine in the loop.Luther traces Robey to Piccadilly Circus, where Raine deploys armed police SCO19 (since they both got their info from Schenk). The two confront Robey there (Luther calls the Killers phone and watches a man in a parka pick up), but some people Robey has blackmailed cause a distraction by killing themselves jumping from buildings and crashing cars. Robey escapes into the London Underground after fighting Luther and murdering an armed policeman (he cuts the man's artery in the leg, which causes him to bleed to death while Luther tries to save him).\nAn officer on Raine's team, Archie, is shown to be in cahoots with Robey.Luther speaks to Raine on the phone and speculates that the killer blackmails his victims to do his bidding. Luther meets Corrine and tells her that Callum was perhaps blackmailed too. He speculates that she has met the killer and that he is in her life. Corrine talks about a man named Tommy who met her at a support group after Callum's death.\nRobey kidnaps Raine's daughter, Anya (Lauryn Ajufo). By now Raine knows the killer's real name. Robey wants Luther dead in exchange for Anya. Raine meets with Luther and reluctantly agrees to work with him. She tells Luther that Robey was suspected of sexual assault 6 yrs ago, but it was never proven. Then his wife was about to leave him, when she was caught in a fire, and horribly scarred, but survived. Again, arson was never proven. Raine tells Luther that Robey has her daughter and she has to deliver Luther to him.\nMeanwhile Raine's team figures out that a \"red Room\" is being organized on the web. The members get to chose how the victims die. The victims profiles match the people who disappeared all over Europe in the last 6-8 weeks.They visit Robey's ex-wife Georgette (Tara Fitzgerald) (the one who was disfigured in the fire. Luther says he knows Georgette tried to stop Robey which is why he set her on fire), discovering he owns property abroad (She agrees to help after Raine says that Robey had Anya). Archie had set a alert on Raine's passport and informs Robey that she has crossed over into mainland Europe. Robey knows that only Georgette could have directed Raine to Europe.\nDS Archie Woodward (Thomas Coombes), Raine's subordinate, is blackmailed by Robey into killing Georgette but is intercepted by Schenk (who was sent by Luther to protect Georgette). Archie commits suicide.Luther and Raine travel to Robey's mansion in rural Norway, where they discover he tortures kidnapped victims on live-stream called \"The Red Bunker\" for his followers. The two are overpowered, and Robey tries to force them to hurt each other to save Anya. Luther reveals Georgette told the police the location and they are en route.\nAfter a brutal fight, the three are able to escape the bunker, and Luther chases Robey into a frozen lake, where Robey drowns. Luther is rescued by police divers and Schenk. Recovering from his injuries back in London he is approached by Cranfield (Guy Williams), a senior official with MI5, who, it is implied, offers him a job in lieu of going back to prison.",

        "synopsis": "Dana Randall (Delta Goodrem) is the pilot for the tiny Queensland company which aids people in the remote area, both for the people living there and for visiting tourists. Her dad Jeff (Roy Billing) chides her for blowing off high-paying visitors to transport a resident's dog (who had been bitten by a snake and would die if it did not receive timely medical care) to the vet, as their bills are mounting.William Mitchell (Joshua Sasse) is sent all the way from London by ITCM Financial, his father Duncan's (Hugh Parker) UK investment firm, to the tropics of Australia to shut down Fullerton Airways. He'd researched companies they have been backing, and pinpoints the small, flailing, family-run seaplane business as ideal for liquidation as it lacks income. He's given a week to visit the company, go over their financial in person and return to the board meeting to shut them down, proving to his father he's ready to move up in the company.\nDuncan says that if William does a good job, he will be made Junior Director at the company.Nikki (Steph Tisdell), Fullerton's airplane mechanic, pushes Dana to find time to date but she insists she's too busy. Dana is dedicated to keeping Fullerton airways going as this was her dead mother's vision and wish.\nThe next morning, Jeff warns them a rep from ITCM Financial is coming for an inspection. Dana is asked to pick up Will from the ferry, and initially they have a testy relationship. Jeff goes out of his way to try and impress William.\nShe is quick to defend their remote air support, although Jeff tries to downplay it. William says that Government subsidizes the cost of fuel for the remote air support flights. But since Fullerton Airways has only one operational plane, it doesn't leave much room for profits.Dana whizzes Will around to a community off the coast of far-north Queensland to deliver parcels to people in need, which she visits every two weeks as otherwise they'd be totally cut off. The plane is 52 years old, and William is claustrophobic.\nAgain, they convince him to accompany her on her rounds a second day. This time the engine kicks out, but luckily Dana manages to keep her cool and lands the plane safely. She fixes the problem and the plane flies again.Afterwards, having drinks in Fullerton, Dana's ex Heath (Simon Brook McLachlan) sees her chemistry with Will and both he and Nikki encourage her to pursue him. So, they spend time together while crossing the tarmac, stargazing and sharing stories about their lives. Dana shares how much her family, and she are connected with the community. This is her purpose is life.A third day of helping Dana, and Will's father loses patience with him. William was supposed to have audited the financial by now, but he hadn't even started yet, as he was busy helping Dana.\nWill tries to convince Duncan that they were wrong to want to write off the small aeronautical company, but Nikki overhears. Dana is chewing out over the news when confirmation of an impending cyclone reaches them.Will helps Dana find an injured Jeff, who'd been trying to help others seek safety against the cyclone. The three-person staff of Fullerton Airways hole up with Will in the hangar's storage room to wait out the storm. He pledges to fight for their company at his headquarters, as he cares about Dana.The next morning, after the storm has passed, Will helps Dana deliver emergency supplies to many remote locations. Working hard all day, by nightfall she has made peace with him. However, as they're closing up the hanger for the night, Jeff announces that ITCM Financial has sent an e-mail, shutting them down immediately.William has returned to London and has been unsuccessful in swaying the board. Dana arrives unannounced, armed with a plan to revamp and expand Fullerton Airways. In response to Duncan's negative response, Will resigns and offers himself to Dana to aid them in their expansion.ITCM Financial backs their endeavor, and Fullerton Airways is shown to have expanded and now has a more professional look, with Will happily installed there with the company and Dana, as the two had fallen for each other.",

        "synopsis": "The film starts in 2017. Four elderly best friends - Lou (Lily Tomlin), Trish (Jane Fonda), Maura (Rita Moreno), and Betty (Sally Field) - are gathered to watch a football game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, the latter being the ladies favorite team. They prepare for a superstition that they think helps the Pats win, involving Betty stepping on a ladder, Trish reading a magazine in the kitchen, Maura sipping tea, and Lou knocking over a bowl of chips. It works and the Pats win, moving on to the Super Bowl. The ladies cheer for their team and for star quarterback Tom Brady.Trish is known for writing an erotica novel about Rob Gronkowski, as well as being a mascot in ads from her younger days. Betty is great with math and numbers, and she is married to scatterbrained Mark (Bob Balaban). Maura moved into a retirement home after the death of her husband, even though he left their house to her. Lou has been in remission from cancer for 16 years. When the ladies learn from their favorite Pats radio show that there is a contest to attend Super Bowl LI, they decide to enter the contest. Maura gets help from her retirement home friend Mickey (Glynn Turman) to make calls (it is implied he is attracted to Maura), while Lou tries to give a heartfelt story about how she and her friends got into watching football when Brady was a rookie, and it got her through her chemo.Lou announces to her friends that they won the contest and are going to the Super Bowl. The ladies make their preparations, with Betty hiding the truth about her trip to Mark. When they try to pick up Maura, she is fast asleep. Trish distracts the manager Tony (Jimmy O Yang) while Lou and Betty sneak up to Maura's room with help from Mickey and break her out.The ladies arrive in Houston, TX for the big event and stay in their hotel, where they are forced to share two beds. Lou gets a call from her daughter Sara (Sarah Gilbert), who notes that doctors have been trying to reach Lou, but she hasn't answered. She also doesn't tell Sara where she really is.The next day, the ladies head out for the NFL Experience. Lou and Maura get into a football-throwing competition with an employee, and Lou shows she's got an arm on her as she wins several bets with other viewers. Trish does an impromptu reading of her Gronk erotica to a crowd of her fans. She meets retired football player Dan O'Callaghan (Harry Hamlin), who takes an interest in Trish. Betty goes to get food and enters a hot wings contest hosted by Guy Fieri. Betty manages to win the contest despite enduring increasingly spicy sauces. Guy invites the ladies to eat barbecue and later invites them to a big party.That night, the ladies attend the party and get in with Dan's help. A young woman that Betty met outside gives her, Lou, and Maura gummies that they did not know had weed in them. Betty realizes that she left the Super Bowl tickets in her fanny pack (which she innocently calls her \"strap-on\") at the wings contest. Lou tries to find Guy, while Maura stumbles upon a poker game and enters, proving she has an incredible hand when it comes to cards. Lou finds Trish and Dan hooking up before joining Betty on the dance floor. When Sara calls again, Lou tells her the truth of her whereabouts. Betty accidentally hits a younger man in the face and comforts him. Trish and Lou find Maura winning in an attempt to buy new tickets, but she learns that the winnings go to charities. Lou gets frustrated outside as the ladies try to comfort her.The following morning, the ladies try to return to the NFL Experience to find Betty's fanny pack, but it's closed. They split up to try and find help. Trish comes across Nat and Pat (Alex Moffat and Rob Corddry), the hosts of the radio show they listen to, and she learns that the actual winners of the contest were a group of four guys called the Tom Brady Support Group since each of them are actually named Tom Brady and feel pressure of living up to QB Brady's name. Maura attempts to get them off a scalper, but he is asking for way too much. Betty ends up running into Guy, and he returns her the fanny pack.When the ladies try to get into the stadium, the head security guard, Chip (Ron Funches), tells them that the tickets they got were fake and that they have been scammed. Lou comes clean to her friends that she bought them online because she fears that this may be the last chance she will have to do something unforgettable, revealing to them that she is afraid to open a letter from the doctors since it could mean her cancer has come back. Lou's friends stick by her side and try to find an alternate way in.The ladies spot Gugu (Billy Porter), a friend that Maura made during the poker game. He agrees to help them get in by posing as his dancers. The four join Gugu and his actual dancers in a little presentation, which impresses the security guard enough to let them pass. The friends get excited as they take their seats. Dan keeps texting Trish, but she tells Betty that she is going to ghost him since she doesn't want to rush into another relationship like with her last husband that cheated on her. Chip spots the ladies when they are featured on the jumbotron, but as he is escorting them out, Dan invites them up to his hospitality box. Trish explains herself to Dan about not wanting to jump so fast into a relationship, but he agrees to take things slow with her.The game starts off poorly with the Pats getting beat by the Atlanta Falcons. The ladies make their way into the coaches booth and work the controls so that Lou can contact Brady through his helmet. She gives him a little speech about how he inspired her when she was going through chemo, and it is enough to encourage Brady to lead the Pats to make a comeback. The Pats play harder and end the game as champions.Maura tells the ladies that she made a bet with a rich jerk who bet against the Pats, and she won some good money. She also speaks to Mickey, telling him to let the staff at the retirement home know she is going to leave and move back into her own house, and she invites Mickey to visit her. Chip finds the ladies and appears to be kicking them out, but he guides them to the locker room to meet the Pats themselves. Betty praises Danny Amendola for his catch record, Maura admires Julian Edelman's beard, Trish gets to meet Gronk, who happens to be a fan of her book, and Lou meets Brady, who thanks her for inspiring him. He also admires her \"80 For Brady\" jersey and asks if he can swap his jersey for hers, which Lou agrees to.In a jump to the year 2020. Sara joins Betty, Trish, and Maura for the next Super Bowl game. It appears as though Lou has died when Trish begins to toast her, but she emerges alive and healthy. The ladies then gather for another epic game.Before the credits roll, the four friends are sitting by the beach with Brady as Maura asks him if he has considered retirement. Brady responds that it's hard to think about retirement \"when you've still got it\", which the four agree too. Finally, there is a text that states the film was inspired by a true story, featuring a picture of the actual four best friends.",

He discovers that his wingman, who had been granted leave, is barred from flying as a consequence of an arm injury sustained during a snowball fight. Seizing the opportunity, he moves to take the latter's place and proceeds to secure permission from his commanding officer to fly home overnight, despite having received his night rating only recently. With an hour's flying-time to RAF Lakenheath and no inclement weather condition for the night, he is cleared to fly.Taking off in his Vampire, Freddie is ordered onto course heading 265\u00b0 at flight level 280 over the North Sea, whereupon Celle's ATC shuts down for the night. Momentarily after exiting landfall, the Vampire suffers multiple-instrument failure, leaving Freddie stranded without navigational guidance. After several attempts to contact Lakenheath for a radio-guided approach fail, he plans a detour to RAF Miriam St. George, located near the coast. With fog having set in, Freddie attempts a last resort by flying a triangular pattern in the hopes of being located on radar.Flying low on fuel, and believing a sea ditch is inevitable, Freddie reminisces past memories with his girlfriend, Lizzie, before writing a final note to her. After flying through an aurora, he notices a nearby plane flying just below him and attempts to contact it. Inching closer to the plane, he identifies it as a Mosquito, but is unable to make radio contact with it. The Mosquito pilot, who is able to contact Freddie, asks if he requires assistance, to which he responds using hand signals. Acknowledging him, the pilot guides him with a steady descent through the fog to a nearby base, before breaking off. After touching down safely, he shares a salute with the pilot, who disappears into the fog.On the ground, Freddie encounters Sergeant Joe Marks, the base's lone officer, who informs him that he had landed at RAF Minton, an abandoned base just ten miles short of Miriam St. George. Taking sanctuary in the officer's mess, Marks informs him that the base used to an epicenter for fighter missions during the Second World War. There, Freddie notices a picture of the Mosquito pilot, whom Marks identifies as John Kavanagh, a Canadian Pathfinder pilot who flew solo patrols to assist stranded pilots after target-marking flights. When Freddie notes to Marks that Kavanagh had guided him into Minton, Marks replies that Kavanagh went missing in action during a patrol on Christmas Eve, 1943.A bewildered Freddie is approached by two officers from Miriam St. George, who had driven down to Minton after noticing his Vampire on radar. When he highlights Marks' help, they inform him that no one has occupied Minton for years. Astounded, he looks up the clear sky before leaving the base.The scene shifts to a rising horizon, where Kavanagh is seen contacting another stranded pilot. An ending note highlights the role of guide-pilots in saving the lives of countless fighter pilots returning from missions during the war.",

        "synopsis": "In Los Angeles in 2003, after an evening of playing poker with another couple, Debbie Dunn (Reese Witherspoon) and Peter Coleman (Ashton Kutcher) have sex and spend the night together in her home. Peter calls Debbie later and says that he is not looking to date anyone as he is unpredictable.\nPeter is a budding writer. Debbie wanted to be an editor, but ended up making practical choices after she has a kid.Twenty years later, Debbie and Peter are best friends. He has moved to New York City and become a successful businessman, while she still lives in Los Angeles and works as an accountant at her son Jack's (Wesley Kimmel) middle school. Debbie calls Peter on his birthday, and they discuss her plans to head to New York soon to complete an accounting program to help her get a better-paying job (she needs this job to pay for Jack medication which costs $1000 per month and is only covered by insurance for another 6 months). During her stay in New York, Debbie will be staying at Peter's apartment.Debbie's ex-husband's (Jimmy) actress girlfriend, Scarlet (Rachel Bloom), is to watch Jack for the week but flakes when she is offered a role in Vancouver for two weeks. Peter, who has just broken up with his girlfriend and is between jobs, offers to go to LA to take care of Jack. Jack is a teenager. Peter knows that Debbie is having a panic attack about leaving Jack back home for a week. He calls Debbie's style Saran Wrap parenting. Zen (Steve Zahn) is Debbie's gardener.\nDebbie is shown to be an overbearing parent to the extent that she tells Jack whom to hang out with at school.\nPeter has been with his current girlfriend Becca (Vella Lovell) for 6 months. She has never met Debbie, but is a bit concerned about how much time Peter spends with her on the phone. She wants to know if she is wasting her time. Peter hesitates and Becca walks out. Peter is a marketing consultant, whose contract has just ended, so he is in between jobs.In California, Peter learns the extent of Debbie's overprotective parenting and decides to help Jack loosen up a little. Peter learns that Jack plays hockey. He cant play basketball, as he is allergic to the gym, no baseball as he is allergic to grass. Debbie has told Jack that playing hockey is too dangerous. Jack is not allowed to watch TV while eating and never before homework. Debbie doesn't allow takeout's at home either.\nPeter learns that Zen is a wealthy man due to a tech buyout and just does Debbie's garden as a hobby.\nPeter gets sky-box tickets to a Los Angeles Kings game and encourages Jack to invite along two classmates (to help him make friends at school), but this goes awry when they ignore him.Meanwhile in New York, Debbie attends her accounting classes and meets Peter's ex-girlfriend, Minka (Zo\u00eb Chao) (who had come to meet Peter for a booty call, but met Debbie instead), who invites her out for drinks. At the bar, Minka helps her catch the attention of book publisher Theo Martin (Jesse Williams) from Duncan Press. Debbie tells Theo that she has read every Duncan Press book ever published. Minka also informs Debbie that Peter has written a novel. This comes as a shock to Debbie as Peter never told her that he wrote a novel. Debbie reads the novel in less than a day and loves it.\nAfter reading the manuscript, Debbie pretends to be an editor as she tries to convince Theo to give it a chance. Theo and Debbie are both divorced and have 13 yr old boys each.\nTheo loves the book and wants to speak with the author.Peter grows closer to Jack and convinces the hockey coach to let him try out for the team. Peter befriends Zen and finds out that he is also Debbie's part time lover.\nMeanwhile, Debbie goes out on a date with Theo, which ends with them having hooked up and spent the night together. Debbie accidentally sets off the apartment's remote camera, leading to Peter witnessing them. Disturbed, he goes to a bar and meets an old girlfriend but cannot bring himself to sleep with her. He realizes that he is in love with Debbie.On Debbie's last day in New York, she passes her exam and unintentionally discovers Peter's hidden mementos of her. When Debbie meets with Theo, he informs her that he has gotten her an interview with a major publisher. When he expresses a desire to continue dating her, she confesses that she is in love with someone else.In Los Angeles, Jack's hockey tryout goes badly, and he ends up injured. Peter calls Debbie, and she is enraged that he endangered her son even though Jack appears to be okay. Jack is happy to be on the hockey team and tells Debbie not to yell at Peter at any cost. Jack loved his week with Peter. She rushes to leave and get back home to Jack and tells Peter to be gone by the time she arrives.\nPeter and Debbie come face-to-face at LAX. After a heated argument, Peter admits that he is in love with Debbie, and they kiss. Six months later, Peter has become a published author and moved in with Debbie.

        "synopsis": "In 1878 in the Montana Territory, gunfighter Colton Briggs is a member of an extrajudicial posse organized to arrest and hang the brother of Walter McAllister, a notorious bandit. Walter and his men try to foil the public execution, resulting in a shootout that leaves Colton and McAllister's son, James, as the only survivors. Colton assures Walter's brother that he won't kill him; his execution was merely a feint to force his brother out of hiding. Enraged, the younger McAllister tries to shoot Colton in the back. Without hesitation, Colton guns him down and calmly rides away as Walter's young nephew James watches.Twenty years later, Colton is a changed man: under the influence of his wife Ruth, he has become a respectable, clean-living merchant with a general store and a small farm, raising a twelve-year-old daughter named Brooke. To Colton's dismay, Brooke is defiant and unruly; he notices that she is also emotionally withdrawn and unable to behave like \"normal folk\", traits that remind him of his former life. Four men ride up to Colton's farm one day; their leader identifies himself as James McAllister. His gang stabs Ruth to death before painting a taunting message with her blood on the wall and leaving.Colton and Brooke return to find Franklin Jarret, the U.S. Marshal tracking the McAllister gang, waiting at the farm with several deputies. As Ruth is buried, Jarret reveals to Brooke that he and Colton were once close friends and that he's proud of Colton giving up his violent ways to raise a family. Before leaving, he urges his old friend not to act on any desire he may have to take revenge on James. Colton decides to do so anyway and tells Brooke that she'll accompany him. Dressing in his old gunfighter's clothes and armed with his old pistols, Colton burns down his farm and house before leaving with Brooke.The pair eventually catch up to Jarret after ambushing a wounded deputy for his horse; James had set a trap for his pursuers, killing three and leaving the others too injured to continue. Colton and Brooke disarm the survivors and threaten to torture them unless Jarret talks. He finally admits that James is traveling to Santa Rosa, a town in southern Colorado, to recover a buried stash of pesos and flee across the border while the heat on him dies down. Colton informs Jarret that he will take a horse and warns him not to interfere with his vengeance or he'll kill him.Reaching Santa Rosa, Colton tells Brooke to visit a local shopkeeper and question him as to James's whereabouts while he waits just outside of town. James isn't fooled and captures Brooke as she tries to leave. Anticipating more ambushes, Colton manages to kill five members of the McAllister gang using his experience and wits before the last remaining member comes out with a shotgun aimed at Brooke. James tells Colton that he has two choices: he can either kill him, at which point Brooke will die, or he can for himself.Taking stock of his situation, Colton chooses to kill the second man as James puts a bullet through his chest. As James crows over his victory, Brooke picks up her father's gun (having learned to shoot during their travels) and avenges him by killing James.Later, Jarret rides in and agrees with Brooke to tell everyone that Colton Briggs died a hero's death apprehending the criminals, in exchange he would keep McAllister gang's money. However, unknown to Jarret, most of the money had been transferred to a pair of saddle bags, which Brooke prepares to ride back home with as the film ends",

        "synopsis": "In 1939 Los Angeles, private detective Philip Marlowe (Liam Neeson) is hired by glamorous heiress Clare Cavendish (Diane Kruger) to find her missing lover, Nico Peterson (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud), a prop master at Pacific Film Studios. He quickly learns that Peterson is dead, having been killed after falling down drunk before a car ran over his head outside the exclusive luxury Corbata Club. Marlowe visits Cavendish to tell her of Peterson's demise, also meeting the Pacific's owner, Philip O'Reilly, the soon-to-be Ambassador to England. O'Reilly is also the financial advisor to Clare's mother.\nClare is married to Richard (Patrick Muldoon). Clare tells Richard that Marlowe is helping her find a missing necklace.\nMarlowe also learns from a homeless guy, living across Peterson's house, that he had seen people coming and going from the house. 2 guys coming to Peterson's house asking for him, had come from Mexico. The car was stolen and was re-sprayed in Mexico.Cavendish reveals she has seen Peterson since his supposed death, driving past her in Tijuana, Mexico. Clare says that Nico was a collector and stored his antiques in his aquarium.\nAnnoyed at her withholding this information, Marlowe goes to leave, running into Cavendish's mother, film star Dorothy Quincannon (Jessica Lange), who fails to learn what service Marlowe is providing to her daughter.Marlowe visits Peterson's grave and encounters a mourning woman but she escapes before he can talk to her. Marlowe convinces his friend, homicide detective Joe Green (Ian Hart), to open a murder investigation now they know the body was not Peterson's. Green admonishes Marlowe for his relentless pursuit of the truth and reveals that the body was identified by the Corbata Club owner, Floyd Hanson (Danny Huston).\nMarlowe meets with Hanson at the club, the pair failing to extract information from each other. Hanson maintains that Nico is dead, and he died on a public road. He refuses to say who is the owner of the club. Marlowe reveals to Hanson that Nico might be alive.\nWhile leaving, Marlowe notices the woman from the grave, Peterson's sister Lynn (Daniela Melchior), and clandestinely agrees to meet with her at the Cabana club later that evening; their discussion is observed by Hanson. When he arrives, Marlowe is assaulted by two men but beats them unconscious.Quincannon tries to hire Marlowe to find Peterson for her instead. She reveals that her contentious relationship with her daughter is because she spent many years pretending Cavendish was her niece on the advice of O'Reilly, Dorothy's former lover. Dorothy says that acknowledging having a daughter would not have been good for her movie career. Dorothy says that Clare is unstable, like her father, who committed suicide before she was born.Quincannon's former private investigator had learned that Peterson was also acting as a talent agent for actress Amanda Toxteth (Se\u00e1na Kerslake). Toxteth tells Marlowe that Peterson was a serial womanizer and regularly imported cocaine from Tijuana.\nAmanda also says that Nico was seeing Clare, the actress with the terrible mother Dorothy. She says that O'Reilly kept Dorothy and even bought a studio for, where Dorothy was a slave for many years.\nOut of leads, Marlowe breaks into Peterson's house and encounters Lynn before the pair are attacked by two Mexican men looking for someone named Serena. Marlowe is knocked unconscious while Lynn is taken captive.After waking, Marlowe is taken by drug lord Lou Hendricks (Alan Cumming) and his henchman Cedric (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Hendricks reveals he is after Peterson, his former drug courier, who stole a large amount of cocaine and the Corbata helped fake Peterson's death. Marlowe has his officer friend Bernie Ohls (Colm Meaney) begin searching for Lynn, while Cavendish visits Marlowe to seduce him; he rejects her advances but shares a dance before she leaves.\nMarlowe secretly follows Cavendish to a rendezvous with O'Reilly and runs into Quincannon who shares her anger at her daughter's relationship with the much older and powerful O'Reilly.\nThe following day, Ohls takes Marlowe to Lynn's body, revealing she was tortured and raped before being killed. Ohls traces the Mexicans to the Corbata club and gives Marlowe his unofficial support to infiltrate the club and avenge Lynn.Marlowe confronts Hanson who offers him a drink. Marlowe says that Lynn was addicted to cocaine and worked for Hanson, who was basically her pimp.\nMarlowe is suspicious Hanson poisoned it, Marlowe throws it away and feigns that he is dying. Convinced he is dead, Hanson has his men take Marlowe's body through the hedonistic areas of the club to a secret area where the Mexicans have been killed, Hendricks is being tortured, and Cedric has been restrained. Under torture, Hendricks reveals that Serena is actually the mermaid statue Peterson placed in the adjacent fish tank and it contains the missing cocaine. Marlowe frees Cedric and the pair kill Hanson and his men, inadvertently destroying the mermaid and the drugs. Cedric also kills Hendricks after being told he will be indebted for years to repay the value of the drugs. Cedric decides to work with Marlowe so they can look out for each other.Marlowe returns home to find Peterson waiting for him. Peterson admits he does not feel guilty about Lynn's death because of her association with him and asks Marlowe to tell Cavendish to meet him in the studio prop house for information he has gathered about O'Reilly.The fake Peterson was a musician who resembled Peterson. Peterson meets Cavendish and reveals his extensive records of every drug deal performed through the prop house with Hendricks, believing it will destroy the reputation of the studio and O'Reilly.\nDorothy sought Nico to expose O'Reilly, while Clare sought Nico to protect O'Reilly.As Marlowe arrives, Cavendish betrays Peterson, shooting him and setting both him and the evidence on fire, immolating the prop house, intending to use this deed to earn favor with O'Reilly and become vice president of the studio. Dorothy starts acting in studio's pictures again.\nShe offers Marlowe a job as the studio's head of security, but he declines, instead recommending Cedric.",

        "synopsis": "The film begins with a car facing a frozen lake while tendrils of smoke fill the view.Set in the early 1960s, Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) sits in her car while a young couple fool around in a nearby car, which she becomes turned on by... eventually shoving snow down her pants. She drives back to her house in a car whose engine causes the cabin to fill with smoke unless the windows are down. Her father, Jim (Shea Whigham), sits in an armchair surrounded by empty liquor bottles, which she replaces as she enters. Going upstairs to her bedroom, she lays on her bed sucking on sweets, then spitting them out before falling asleep.The following morning, she arrives at the boy's prison in which she works as a secretary. Watching from the window, Eileen takes notice of a young man, Lee Polk (Sam Nivola), leaning up against the wall away from all of the other prisoners. At visiting hours, she pats down all of the women coming to visit, then fantasizes about a young guard and touches herself. While leaving, she passes the going away party for the prison psychologist, Dr. Frye, who is being replaced the following day.When Eileen arrives home, she finds Jim drunk in the street pointing his gun at passersby, while a policeman, Buck (Jefferson White), attempts to calm him down. She gets him back inside and, since Jim is a former police chief, the officer leaves him in her care. Her father then berates her for not being as good as her sister or her deceased mother and for not making a life of her own. To keep him from going back outside, Eileen takes all of his pairs of shoes and locks them in the boot of her car.One day, Rebecca St. John (Anne Hathaway) arrives at the prison, taking the role of the new prison psychologist. Eileen is immediately taken by her beauty and style, and they bond over their apathy towards what others think. The annual Christmas pageant arrives, which is quickly mocked and ruined by a rowdy group of prisoners. Rebecca takes notes, then leaves hastily once the fighting breaks out. On the way home, Eileen buys a pack of cigarettes, which Rebecca had been seen to be smoking that day. Jim reveals that Lee Polk is in jail for killing his father, another former cop, and hasn't said a word to anyone since the brutal murder.When arriving at work the next day, Eileen stares at Lee Polk through the window of his cell, then peruses through his file... including graphic pictures of the murder. Rebecca catches her and helps her clean up, then laments about the lack of suitable men in the area and invites Eileen to stop by her office sometime.The following morning, Anne Polk (Marin Ireland) arrives to visit her son, having been called in by Rebecca. However, Lee refuses to speak to her, and she leaves in an angry fit. Rebecca takes him back to her office, which Eileen drops by to give her back her notebook. Rebecca seems worried that she may have read it, then invites her out for drinks at the local bar. Eileen gets dressed in her best clothes and sneaks out of the house. At the bar, the girls drink and chat, then begin dancing together - even fending off the advances of other men to stay together. At the end of the night Rebecca kisses Eileen, which leaves her stunned and smiling. Eileen decides to stay at the bar, smoking one of Rebecca's cigarettes and drinking martinis.Eileen awakens in her car in a pile of her own vomit, having been locked out of the house by her father. While cleaning up the car, Buck returns to alert her that there have been complaints about Jim pointing his gun at children coming home from school. It has been arranged that the gun will be placed in Eileen's care, though under the condition she not use it against Jim. Immediately, she begins having fantasies about killing herself and her father with it.Upon arriving at work, Eileen finds that Rebecca will not return until after the holidays. Upset and hurt, Eileen breaks into Rebecca's office and spends the day sleeping on her desk. She returns home and finds Jim passed out in his own blood, having fallen down the stairs. She takes him to the hospital, where the doctors bandage him up and alert Eileen that this drinking is on track to kill him. When they return home, Jim insists on having a drink with Eileen, but ends up telling her that she's the kind of person that doesn't matter and simply fills up space, causing her to cry.The following day, Rebecca calls and invites Eileen over to her house for Christmas Eve. Eileen is ecstatic and rushes to get dressed up for their evening. Over wine, the pair discuss the idea of being \"normal\" and Rebecca's frustrations about not seeing the change she hoped for in the prison. Rebecca discloses that Lee claims his father had been molesting him and that his mother had been complicit in it. She then reveals that this is not her house, but rather the Polk house, and she has Mrs. Polk tied up and drugged in the basement until she confesses to her part in the abuse. While originally aghast and horrified, Eileen is convinced to stay and gathers her father's gun from the car.Under Rebecca's direction, Eileen threatens to shoot Mrs. Polk if she doesn't confess. Eventually, Mrs. Polk breaks down and reveals that, while she didn't originally know about the abuse, she had found out but remained complicit because she liked the intimacy with her husband afterwards. Even going so far as to give Lee a bath and an enema before bed to \"make it easier for all of them.\" Enraged, Eileen shoots Mrs. Polk in the shoulder, who begins screaming. Rebecca is horrified and rushes to stop the blood and screaming, eventually helping Eileen force feed Mrs. Polk medication to knock her out. Eileen suggests that they should take Mrs. Polk to Jim's house, as people would believe that he shot her during a blackout. She confesses her love for Rebecca and tells her that it will all be okay. Rebecca agrees to the plan, saying she will clean up the basement, then meet Eileen there.Eileen arrives back at the house, packs her bag, and waits for Rebecca, who never shows. Eileen instead decides to take the car to the woods and leave it running with Mrs. Polk in the back to asphyxiate, then hitchhikes down the road. In the final shot, as Eileen sits in the cab of the truck, she smiles to herself.",

        "synopsis": "Anne, a tightly wound, game show-obsessed young woman, receives a call notifying her that her gambling addict mother has fled to Macau. This news reunites her with her estranged and reckless older sister, Jenny. Jenny, who had previously been living in her car, temporarily moves in with Anne. One night while Anne is watching her favorite game show, Can't Stop the Quiz, Jenny secretly records Anne answering every question at remarkable speed and uploads it online. The video goes viral overnight, drawing the attention of a loan shark to whom Anne and Jenny's mother owes $80,000. Tracking down Anne, he demands that she pay off her mother's debt and informs her that he has kidnapped her pet dog, Mr. Linguini, as ransom. Anne blames Jenny for the mishap and asks her to use money she won from a lawsuit against a restaurant chain to pay the ransom; however, Jenny reveals she lied about winning the case and that she cannot pay off the debt. Instead, she encourages Anne-whose video gained the attention of Can't Stop the Quiz casting directors-to go on the show and win enough money to get Mr. Linguini back.Prior to the audition for the show, Jenny dislocates her wrist at a bar. While waiting at the doctors office and reminiscing about old times, Anne admits to defecating into a hole when staying at their cousins' house in Burbank one summer when they were younger, due to her being too uncomfortable and unwelcome to do so inside the house. Jenny comforts her, saying that the cousins never liked their side of the family anyway, claiming it to be the reason why they never stayed with them again. During the audition, Anne, initially nervous about being in front of a crowd of people, tries to leave before it begins, but Jenny gives her some calming pills that are later revealed to be hallucinogens. After being given other pills to calm the effects of the first one, Anne does well at the audition, impressing the crowd and the producers.The next morning, Jenny congratulates Anne and reveals to her that this was all part of her plan to become a self-described life coach, stating that she lied about lying and really did have a large check coming in from her lawsuit and she tricked Anne because she knew that she would not have gone on the show without her thinking she had no other choice.

        "synopsis": "In 1962, Boston Record American reporter Loretta McLaughlin investigates three cases of older women who were raped and murdered by strangulation in the Boston area. She confirms the victims all had stockings tied around their necks in a bow, probably connecting the crimes to a serial killer. The story angers Boston law enforcement as well as Loretta's boss, who plans to kill the report to protect the company.When a fourth victim is found, Loretta and fellow reporter Jean Cole decide to continue the investigation. The two women endure rampant sexism in their workplace and society. Loretta's marriage is strained by her long hours and her family is harassed. While writing the articles, Loretta coins the name \"the Boston Strangler\".One year later, a seventh woman named Sophie Clark is murdered. A neighbor encountered a man who could be the killer and she provides a vague description. Sophie is much younger than previous victims, which breaks the Strangler's pattern. Loretta and Jean later discover that the Boston Police Department is botching the investigation and not sharing information with other cities. Similar murders, like one committed in New York City by a man named Paul Dempsey, have been overlooked.Albert DeSalvo, a suspect in the investigation, is taken into custody. Sophie's neighbor is asked to identify him in a line-up but she picks a different man, George Nassar. Despite this, in 1964, DeSalvo confesses to all 13 murders. Police do not have enough evidence to tie him to the murders, so he is instead convicted for earlier crimes of robbery and sexual offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.By 1965, Loretta learns from a police detective in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that there have been six murders there that are identical to the Boston Strangler's work. She travels to Ann Arbor and learns the most likely suspect is Daniel Marsh, an ex-boyfriend of a Strangler victim. Marsh is later arrested but refuses to cooperate with police. In 1973, DeSalvo calls Loretta and tells her to come to visiting hours the next day to hear his side of the story. Before Loretta can meet with him, he is stabbed to death by another prisoner.Following an anonymous tip, Loretta meets with Harrison, a former patient at Bridgewater State Hospital. He reveals that DeSalvo, Marsh and Nassar were all held in the same ward at the same time. Harrison also claims DeSalvo's confession was coached by Marsh and Nassar. Loretta visits Nassar in prison. He denies that he and Marsh coached DeSalvo but admits he hoped to claim the reward. He accuses Loretta and the media of creating a sensation around the Strangler and insinuates that there is more than one murderer but that the public does not want to come to terms with it.Loretta and Jean create a theory that Paul Dempsey killed the first six older women in Boston before he moved to New York. Once Dempsey left Boston, copycat murders arose, resulting in the later victims being much younger. DeSalvo confessed to all 13 murders so Nassar could collect a $10,000 reward per victim. In return, Nassar arranged for DeSalvo to be represented by high-profile lawyer F. Lee Bailey. DeSalvo was also deceived into believing he would get a million-dollar book deal that could support his family. The Record American publishes Loretta and Jean's theory.An epilogue tells of Loretta becoming an award-winning medical reporter at The Boston Globe. Jean continued working as a reporter for 30 years. She and Loretta remained close friends. Marsh was never charged with murder. Nassar never received a reward and is incorrectly said to still be in prison as of 2023.[a] In 2013, DNA evidence linked DeSalvo to the 13th murder but not the other 12",
        "plot": "Loretta McLaughlin was the reporter who first connected the murders and broke the story of the Boston Strangler. She and Jean Cole challenged the sexism of the early 1960s to report on the city's most notorious serial killer."

        "synopsis": "The town of Baltese had lost its hope in magic and warmth after the war, which is why nobody had any time to waste fantasizing about wild and exotic animals; there were only domesticated animals reared for produce. The very first mention of the elephant is when Peter, a young orphan raised by a soldier toughened by his time at the war-front, Vilna Lutz (Mandy Patinkin), approaches a fortune teller out of curiosity. Vilna had sent Peter on an errand to buy old bread and a small fish as he trained Peter for another inevitable war so as to increase his chances of survival. Vilna saved Peter (Noah Jupe) from the war-front after his whole family had been wiped out. He brought him up in harsh conditions so that Peter wouldn't lose his life and stay alive in even the worst conditions caused by war.Vilna's only guilt had been that he could not save Peter's sister, Adele (Pixie Davies), and thus he had lied to him about her dying at birth. He could not bring himself to tell Peter that it was his decision to take him away and entrust Adele to Sister Marie. But, a bomb later wiped out the house housing Sister Marie and Adele, which is why Vilna thought they had died then. Therefore, Peter lived with this as the truth and never sought out Adele.\nVilna argued that if Peter had hope, he would never grow up to be a good soldier. He tells the story of a young recruit, who used to find comfort in fairy tales. Vilna took away his story book and the recruit grew up to become the most feared soldier in the King's army.\nAs he arrived at the town square to buy his daily dinner, Peter, intrigued by the Fortune Teller's (Natasia Demetriou) tent as well as how well she seemed to know him, decided to spend his only coin designated for food on a question that changed his life. The Fortune Teller mentioned that his sister Adele was alive and that if he wanted to find her, he would have to follow the elephant.The story of following an elephant seemed just that-a story. However, impossibility gave way to likelihood when the opening act of a terrible magician at the opera summoned an elephant out of thin air, using a magic spell. Albeit, it was a fluke, as the magician (Benedict Wong) simply desired to bring back the lost hope, warmth, and magic of Baltese.\nBoth the elephant and the magician were locked up as the weight of the elephant had crushed the legs of a noblewoman attending the show. However, the arrival of the elephant brought joy and hope to two individuals: one was Peter, who sought his sister, and the other was surprisingly his sister Adele, who had dreamed of an elephant leading her to her brother earlier that day.Adele had been safely raised by her nurse, Sister Marie (Dawn French ), who had traveled to the army camp on the words of Vilna only to find it destroyed due to another bomb. Sister Marie had taken Adele away from the city to take care of her on the outskirts, away from any harm. Sister Marie also had the same guilt as Vilna, where she was constantly reminded of how she had let Peter go and that she should have saved them both. She loved Adele and thus gave in to her wishes when she asked to visit the elephant, as Adele saw her as a sign of hope.Peter decided to save the locked-up elephant in order to find his little sister, and his downstairs neighbor, Leo Matiennel (Brian Tyree Henry), decided to help him. Leo is an official of the King's court and a captain of the Palace Guards.\nLeo then notified the King (Aasif Mandvi) of the arrival of an elephant in the town of Baltese to intrigue him into visiting the town when he saw that the Countess (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) was not bending to his request for the elephant to be released. The countess was swayed by the court who thought the elephant to be an instrument of a foreign power and wants to kill the elephant.\nThe arrival of the King signified a shift in power. Leo invites Peter to the court at the unveiling of the Elephant. Peter saves the day by washing the elephant's eye when it was getting agitated due to chalk residue falling into its eye. Peter says that the Elephant is detained to lead him to his lost sister and asks for custody of the Elephant.\nDue to his love for dramatics and flair, the King decided on three impossible tasks for Peter to complete so as to own the elephant.\nHis first task was to defeat Romain De Smedt, who was a one-man killing machine. Peter recognizes him as the same person from whom Vilna stole the book of fairy tales. He ran across the town, evading Romain and got the book. Peter won him over by returning Romain's lost book that had been stolen by Vilna so as to push him to become the soldier he was so he would survive.The second task had been for Peter to fly, and this is where the efforts of Leo and his wife Gloria (Sian Clifford) came through. They designed a parachute for him, and Peter used it to glide through the air, successfully mimicking the art of flight, which he used to win over the King as well.\nDeclared the winner of yet another round, Peter was set up for another impossible task, which was to make the Countess, who had been known for her stoicism after she lost her brother to war, laugh. He had been rather unsuccessful with his joke, although the Countess tried a fake laugh to help him out.\nThe King just wanted her to enjoy the moment and thus decided that would not fly by. However, the plot armor decided that it wanted Peter to win and thus made the elephant sneeze all over the King. Seeing the most powerful man in the kingdom covered in snot, the Countess burst out laughing, which genuinely made the King smile as well. He declared Peter the winner.Peter, after two of those tasks, had already changed his mind about using the elephant to find Adele; rather, he had come around to helping the elephant find its own family. Peter regularly took care of the elephant and thus had a bond with her.\nSo, when the King announced that Peter had lost the privilege to own the elephant, Peter was very upset, as he now simply wanted the elephant to return to her natural habitat, as she surely did not belong in the city. This is why the plot armor had taken matters into its own hands and thought fit to let Peter win after all. The elephant symbolized the lost trust, light, and hope that the town of Baltese had.\nThe Countess finally laughed for the first time since she had lost her brother and locked her emotions down, which meant the return of her emotions. The magician had been terrible at his own art due to the fact that the people of the town chose not to believe in their own emotions as well as in hope and magic. Also, the complaining attitude and the judgmental look of the noblewoman, a mighty Karen right there, had made matters worse for now, as the town had locked up the magician, who had failed his final trick to return the warmth that once was in the town of Baltese. The magician, now equipped with the belief and trust of the townsfolk, was now able to channel the spirit of magic and was able to send the elephant back to her natural habitat.Meanwhile, Adele had unknowingly met her brother Peter, who had been troubled with the task of making the Countess laugh. Their interaction had been brief but spoke of familiarity. They met again when Adele came around to ask Peter why he had let the elephant go, as he was meant to follow her to find his destiny. With the disappearance of the elephant came light and hope that cleared out the dark, gloomy clouds, lifting the curse of the town and letting the light shine through.\nMeanwhile, Vilna found the courage to finally get out of his house and walk around with his cane instead of the wheelchair. As he reached the town, clearly proud and impressed, he came across Sister Marie, whom he had thought had lost her life along with baby Adele. Sister Marie couldn't believe her eyes when she realized that Peter and Vilna had been alive all this time. Thus, sparking a reunion, it marked the town's overcoming a long war where they had forgotten how to feel and thus ridding Baltese of its gloomy clouds for good. The story ends on a warm note, with the sounds of joy and laughter echoing through every street of the town as Peter enjoys a meal with his newfound family.",

        "synopsis": "Cheryl (Ashley Madekwe), a black woman, is living in an undisclosed location in England. She expresses concerns about discrimination and financial difficulties to her sister on the phone. The subsequent scenes show her rejecting phone calls from her spouse and leaving a message on the fridge about going to the hair salon.Several years later, we are introduced to Neve, a fair-skinned black woman married to Ian (Justin Salinger), a non-black man, with two biracial children, Sebastian (Samuel Small) and Mary (Maria Almeida). She is disdainful of anything associated with \"black\" lifestyle. Neve works at her kids' school as a deputy headmistress and plans to host a fund-raising gala at her home. She often gets visions of black people and gets disturbed.\nNeve wears a wig to hide her true hair. Neve receives a toy car in the mail which she seems to recognize.\nAs a headmistress, Neve is very successful, but she still hasn't provided her past references to the school. Neve sees Sebastian talking to a black boy at school, and then finds him skipping a class to go into the surrounding woods to smoke a cigarette.\nMary goes ahead and braids her hair in an ethnic style, based on fashion she saw in a YouTube video. Neve is livid with Mary for adopting that hair style.\nSebastian is late coming home from a basketball game and Neve starts hitting him. Neve tries to get the black boy fired, bit is told that it will look and feel like discrimination. The boy confronts Neve in the boy's room where he accuses Neve of abandoning him and Dione.\nAt a fund-raising gala at her home, Neve confronts two black individuals that she believes to be strangers; they address her as their mother.Flashbacks to five days prior, with \"Carl and Dione\" being the focus of the story, the two, black teens Neve has been seeing all over the town and even in the school. The two are on an unknown mission that involves staying at a hotel, with Carl taking on the name \"Marvin (Jorden Myrie)\" and getting a job as the school janitor and Dione taking the name \"Abigail (Bukky Bakray)\" and working as an assistant in Ian's office.\nThey befriend Neve's children, Dione inviting Mary to the hotel room for drinking and partying. Dione braided Mary's hair in an ethnic way. Carl invites Sebastian to smoke, after his basketball game which is why he was late going back to home. Afterwards, Carl convinces Sebastian to brutally attack his school bully.\nMary invites Dione to her mother's gala, which is why Carl and Dione showed up there.In the present day, it is revealed that Neve is Cheryl, and Carl and Dione are indeed her children. Cheryl tells Ian that her husband was a bad man and thus she left. Ian knows that Cheryl left as she could not stand her black life. Cheryl feels she is justified as fathers get to walk away from their family all the time.\nShe meets them at a diner and gives them ten thousand pounds each in order to help them back on their feet as they return to London. She explains that their father was a bad man and that she left the kids with their auntie. But the auntie didn't want the kids and gave them away. Carl and Dione want to move into the big house with Cheryl/Neve.\nHowever, Carl and Dione break into Neve's house. Carl takes everyone's phones and dumps them in the sink, where he turns on the water that starts to flood the living room. Carl and Dione claim it's Dione's birthday and they should celebrate as a family and force the family to order Uber Eats.Carl confronts Neve for trying to pay them off, which was unknown to the rest of her family. This leads to Ian threatening a divorce, however, Dione intervenes and suggests playing a board game. Neve, who is visibly upset, vomits. Afterwards, she appears to adopt a new and happy persona, and the group begins to play Scrabble. Carl becomes annoyed and forfeits the game before demanding that Ian accompany him to the family's gym. There, Carl coerces Ian to lift increasingly heavy weights until he is unable to hold them, and the weight falls on him, resulting in his apparent death.Meanwhile, after the Uber Eats driver arrives, Neve tells the group she will tip the driver and be right back; she does not return. The driver's engine starts up and drives away, implying that Neve has left with him. Mary and Sebastian are left standing in the flooded living room with Dione and Carl, as Neve has now abandoned her second set of children.",

        "synopsis": "The opening scene shows hundreds of people crowded around a quarantined area. A young Thomas is brought by his mother to be taken away for protection on board a train. She tells him she loves him and they never see each other again. On the train, Thomas meets Dr. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson).In the present, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the rest of the Gladers; Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Frypan (Dexter Darden), and Winston (Alexander Flores) are brought to the desolated city following their escape from the Maze. Once they descend, a horde of infected people (\"Cranks\") start running towards them, but the mercenary soldiers (\"mercs\") escorting them fight them off. They take the Gladers into a facility run by Janson (Aidan Gillen). He says this place will provide the Gladers with shelter, food, clothes, and protection from \"The Flare\".Thomas joins Minho and the other boys in a cafeteria. They see other groups of people their age, meaning they weren't the only ones that survived a Maze. Frypan points out one boy, Aris (Jacob Lofland), who has been in a Maze the longest, and in one with mostly girls. Janson then walks in and calls on the names of several people for what is supposedly a relocation. Teresa's name is called and she joins the others as they walk out.That night, Aris gets Thomas out of bed and guides him through the vents to show him the room where a number of bodies are wheeled into a room for tests and research. Thomas starts to think they're doing something bad with Teresa.The next day, another group of people are called out. Thomas gets into a brief scuffle with a guard to steal his ID badge. That night, he and his friends sneak out of their rooms to find Teresa and the others. Thomas encounters them all hung up to a mechanism of sorts, and all of them are unconscious. Thomas then walks into a room where he sees Janson talking to Ava through a projection. He's been running tests to see who is immune to The Flare, and he mentions trying to find a group called The Right Arm and their grounds called Safe Haven. Thomas realizes Janson works for the World in Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD).Thomas gathers Newt, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Aris, and tries to find Teresa so they can escape. They come across a merc who aims his stun gun at them, until Minho dropkicks him into a wall. Thomas grabs the gun and gets a doctor to take them to Teresa. They grab her and head out to the exit. Janson and some other mercs try to stop them, saying they won't last long out their in \"The Scorch\". Thomas fends them off and barely makes it out with the others.Now on the outside in a vast desert, the Gladers venture toward the mountains to find The Right Arm. They come across an abandoned building and discover the place has power, but when they turn it on, Thomas and Minho are attacked and chased by some Cranks. The chase escalates when the cranks and mercs run into each other. As they find an exit, Winston holds them off with a gun, but one of the Cranks attacks him and scratches him. The others pull him out.The Gladers continue walking through the mounds of sand as day breaks. Winston collapses, as he's been infected and it's spreading rapidly through his body. He only wants to be put out of his misery and not transform into a Crank. Frypan takes out a gun, which Newt takes from him and hands to Winston. Winston says his goodbyes to his friends, and they leave him. On their walk, they all hear a single gunshot.As the others rest for the night, Thomas spots a civilization in the distance. When the gang keeps moving, a massive lightning storm starts brewing. Powerful bolts strike down, hitting Minho but non-fatally. His friends grab him and they run into another building. There, they find dozens of chained Cranks. Out of the shadows comes Brenda (Rosa Salazar), who lives there with a group of survivors. She guides the Gladers to her leader/surrogate father figure Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito). He notices the tattoos on the backs of the Gladers' necks, realizing they came from a WCKD facility and that they are valuable. Jorge also learns they are looking for The Right Arm.Soon, a band of WCKD mercs, led by Janson, storms the place. Thomas runs away with Brenda, separating himself from the other Gladers. Jorge plays a song that triggers a series of explosives when it finishes. The facility collapses and kills the mercs. Thomas and Brenda run toward an exit as they are pursued by Cranks. They run outside into a collapsed building. Brenda slips and nearly falls through a window. A Crank emerges and attacks her, but Thomas breaks the glass and causes the Crank to fall out while he pulls Brenda up.The two head on to find the others and come across a nightclub of sorts, run by another survivor, Marcus (Alan Tudyk). He knows something about The Right Arm, but he doesn't tell Thomas and Brenda of his identity, and instead gives them a drink for them to get in the feel of the party. Thomas trips out a bit, and Brenda approaches him. They move in to kiss, but Thomas only sees himself kissing Teresa. He tells Brenda she isn't Teresa, leaving her disappointed.After experiencing trippy visions, Thomas wakes up to find Teresa and Minho sitting over him. He and Brenda are back with Jorge and the Gladers, and Thomas finds Jorge beating Marcus's face in. After a few good punches, Marcus tells the gang where they can find The Right Arm.The group takes Marcus's car and drives by a mountain with many abandoned cars. When they get out, gunshots are fired at them. Jorge hands Thomas a bomb to use a distraction, but they are cornered by two female shooters, Harriet (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Sonya (Katherine McNamara). They recognize Aris and decide the group poses no threat to them.The ladies guide the group to meet the rest of The Right Arm, including their leader Vince (Barry Pepper). Brenda collapses, as she's been bitten by a Crank, but her infection hasn't spread as quickly as with Winston. Vince nearly shoots her until he is stopped by a former WCKD scientist named Mary Cooper (Lili Taylor). She reveals that Thomas was an informant to share information on all of WCKD's acts. She gives Brenda an enzyme shot to stop the infection from spreading.Thomas sits by Brenda's bedside. She mentions losing her mom to The Flare. Thomas pulls out the small totem given to him by Chuck, as he remembers the boy's sacrifice.That night, Thomas talks with Teresa. She says that she watched her mom go mad from The Flare, and she didn't want to give up on the rest of the infected... which is why she's been working for WCKD the whole time. WCKD helicopters are seen heading toward the mountains, as Teresa called them and told them where they are. Thomas runs to warn everyone, only for the choppers to start firing missiles at the people. The mercs descend and start attacking people. Thomas departs from Jorge and Brenda to save his friends. Ava and Janson step out, confirming that Teresa has been with WCKD from the beginning. Janson shoots and kills Mary, and he nearly kills again until Jorge drives in on a van, leading to a battle between WCKD mercs and The Right Arm. Janson nearly kills Thomas until Brenda shoots him in the shoulder. Thomas uses Jorge's bomb on a group of mercs. Minho gets shot with a stun gun and is taken by the mercs. Ava, Teresa, and Janson escape with Minho as Thomas helplessly watches the craft take off.In the morning, the survivors seem to have lost hope. Thomas gathers what he can carry and decides he's going back to infiltrate WCKD, rescue Minho, and kill Ava. Although Vince thinks he's crazy, Harriet agrees that she wouldn't mind some revenge. Now, everyone looks to Thomas as they prepare to take WCKD down.To be continued......",

        "synopsis": "Tom is the owner of a used bookstore in New York City. One day, a woman named Sandra comes in looking for a book, and after initially declining his advances, the two begin a romance. Weeks into their relationship, Sandra tells Tom that her brother is in debt and must pay $350,000 or be killed. Tom reveals that his father is wealthy, and offers to cover the debt. After providing the money to Sandra, she disappears, pushing Tom into a nervous breakdown.\nSandra's past is revealed as a parolee with a long criminal history. One night, before her relationship with Tom, she is meeting with her parole officer, who attempts to shake her down for money. She is paid off by an apparently wealthy man, Max, who is actually a con artist. He takes Sandra on as a partner, and trains her to pull cons. After taking down their first mark together, the two have sex.\nBefore his partnership with Sandra, Max visits his mother, Madeline, and her new boyfriend, billionaire Richard Hobbes, at Richard's lavish apartment. Max, who appears drunk and belligerent, convinces Madeline to allow him to stay at Richard's apartment. The next day, Madeline and Richard come home to Max apparently being arrested for soliciting drugs from an undercover police officer. Madeline quickly realizes that Max is pulling a con to have Richard pay off the officer, Max's partner Tipsy. Madeline forces Max to leave the apartment, but it is later revealed that Madeline and Max are lovers, not mother and son, and are targeting Richard.\nRichard meets with Max, who demands a year's salary in cash in order to leave Madeline alone to be with Richard. While meeting with him, Max also meets Richard's son-Tom, who has not yet met Sandra. Max, Madeline, and Tipsy celebrate a successful job, but that evening, Madeline tells Max that Richard wants to marry her, and she will be staying with him. Max escapes from the police Madeline has called and leaves with the money.\nRichard dies, leaving the vast majority of his estate to Madeline. Due to Richard's misgivings about Tom after the incident with Sandra, Tom has been left only the bookstore. He has also been named chairman of Richard's foundation, while Madeline is a trustee.\nTom hires an old family friend, Braddock, to locate Sandra. Despite Madeline's attempts to convince Tom to call off the investigation, Sandra is found, heavily addicted to heroin. Tom wants her to stay at the apartment while she goes through detox, but Madeline is reticent. She speaks to Sandra, who reveals that she knows the connection between Madeline and Max. In return for her silence, Sandra demands that Madeline track down Max so she can confront him about abandoning her.\nMax agrees to meet with Sandra and Madeline. During the meeting, Tom and Braddock arrive to confirm Tom's suspicions that the three had been working together. Tom pulls a gun on Sandra, then on Madeline. Sandra forces the gun out of Tom's hands, and it is picked up by Madeline, who apparently shoots and kills Tom after he forces her to point the gun at him and pull the trigger. Desperate to avoid prison, Madeline immediately transfers all the money to Richard's foundation.\nMadeline, Max, and Sandra are put on a plane to Oklahoma City. Madeline reminds Max that she will retain control of the money, since Tom is dead and she is the trustee of Richard's foundation. After a distraught Sandra retreats to the bathroom, Madeline realizes that the blood on her sleeve is not real, meaning Tom is alive. When Madeline checks the bathroom, Sandra is gone.\nThe true nature of the scheme is revealed; Sandra-who prefers going by \"Sandy\"-confesses the truth to Tom and the two devise a plan to con Madeline and Max, enlisting Tipsy and his partner Goldie-who posed as \"Braddock\"-to assist them. The meeting between Sandra and Max was planned, as was Tom's apparent shooting at Madeline's hands. Since Tom is still alive, he maintains control over the foundation and the money. Tom, Sandra, Tipsy, and Goldie meet at the bookstore to celebrate their success. Tom and Sandra begin to rekindle their relationship.",

        "synopsis": "One year after the last owners fled in terror, the Presleys are shown a house. Suspicious of the low price, the estate agent Barbara (Faith Ford) insists that recently prices have been low. Kevin is a guitarist. He doesn't get along with his father Frank.\nOn the first night Kevin (Jahi Winston), the youngest, investigates a sound in the attic. Using his mobile phone light, a ghost appears. When he fails to scare Kevin but is instead met with a laugh, he vanishes. Kevin returns to the attic and sits down to talk with the ghost, only to discover that he is mute and does not remember his life back when he was alive. Kevin calls him Ernest (David Harbour) as that is the name on his bowling shirt. Suddenly Kevin's big brother Fulton (Niles Fitch) barges in and begins bullying Kevin for his phone, causing Ernest to help him. Fulton finds a video Kevin had recorded of Ernest when he first saw him and soon shows their father Frank (Anthony Mackie) that their new home is haunted by a ghost. Frank creates a YouTube channel, where the increased footage of Ernest eventually convince the public of his existence, turning the Presleys Internet-famous.\nMeanwhile Kevin tries to jog Ernest's memory by giving visual stimuli. He believes that memory loss is associated to trauma. Kevin wants to help Ernest as he is stuck and nobody wants to be stuck.In high school Kevin meets Joy (Isabella Russo), the neighbor, who reveals to his house as the \"House of Death\" due to its abandoned state. Once the video of Ernest goes viral, they cross paths in the library and Joy quickly finds that the house's owner Ernest S. lived there from '65 to '71 and is now residing elsewhere, but he is not the titular ghost. The West Bay cable TV medium Judy Romano (Jennifer Coolidge) comes to film meeting Ernest.\nFrustrated with Frank for taking advantage of Ernest (Frank wants to monetize Ernest with merchandise, book deals etc) and failing to connect with him, Kevin shows Ernest various horror clips to help him scare off the set. It doesn't take long for Ernest to scare her crew and eventually Judy, who, while reacting in terror, jumps out the window. Frank is furious with Kevin and Ernest, but quickly profits off of the haunting and continues to ignore Kevin's warnings.Joy convinces Kevin that they need to take Ernest out to a bar once belonging to the house's past owner to try and jog his memory. They start to uncover the truth about Ernest's past, discovering a photo of him with the previous house owner, and a little blonde girl at the park who gives Ernest vague flashbacks. Unfortunately, he unintentionally scares the child, causing the public to believe Ernest is malevolent.\nMeanwhile Frank is busy merchandising Ernest and launching new revenue streams like a cartoon series and so on.Horror writer Dr. Leslie Monroe (Tig Notaro) visits Frank and Melanie (Erica Ash), telling them about an old program she ran with the CIA called Wizard Clip, with its goal in mind to capture a ghost. When costs of the program was made known to the public they scrapped it, making her the scapegoat. When she tries to convince them that Ernest is dangerous, Frank throws her out, but the viral video of Ernest at the park sets the CIA in motion. They break into the Presley home, but Kevin, Joy and Ernest have already left for Oklahoma to find the past house owner. The next morning the Presleys are coerced into doing an appeal to apprehend the trio. The broadcast comes on a convenience store TV and they outrun the many police cruisers chasing them.\nMeanwhile the bar owner contacts the CIA and shares the picture of Ernest with the previous house owner.Arriving at the house in Oklahoma, the man, Ernest S. (Tom Bower), identifies Ernest as Randy, the brother-in-law of Ernest S.'s wife, Ramona. He claims that Randy became a drunk, not able to cope with his wife's death from giving birth. He left his four-year-old daughter with them and disappeared. The couple did not plan to have kids initially as they preferred to travel but instead continued to raise their niece, June. Ernest S says that perhaps Randy committed suicide or drank himself to death.\nErnest makes himself visible, and the CIA swoops in. Back home, Kevin is depressed. Frank apologizes to him, recognizing he's been selfish at the family's expense, and tells Kevin he's a much better man than he is.In the CIA facility, an aggressive agent is wearing a pin which triggers Ernest's memory. During a visit to the house, Ramona carried June away (Jo-Ann Robinson) while Ernest S. killed him with a blow to the head. Ernest is being acted upon for not complying, but Dr. Monroe rescues him, realizing he is not dangerous as well as the government's intentions for him.\nErnest S. shows up at the house to kill Kevin, believing he's helping ghost Ernest get revenge. He reveals that when Randy's wife died, Ramona (who was infertile) plotted to murder Randy and take June for their own, with Ernest S. finishing the job for her. He chases him to the attic, where Ernest and Frank tackle him out of the window.\nThe CIA interrogates Kevin, seeking Ernest the ghost. He doesn't divulge anything, but a flashback reveals that Kevin and Frank reunited him with his now 50+ year-old daughter June. Happy at last, Ernest finally is at peace and moves on to the afterlife, but not before sharing a heartwarming goodbye with Kevin.The Presleys have a new moving day, but this time only a few miles away, and Kevin and Joy are now a couple. As Kevin leaves the house, a light flickers in the attic.",

His mother Jackie was a cigarette girl at the Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe.\nSly was born in a charity hospital and had an accident which paralyzed all the nerves on the left side of his mouth. He was hence born with a snarl.\nSly's & Frank Stallone's parents fought all the time. The kids lived at a boarding house since the parents never had time for them. The kids were deprived and were not nurtured. But they got the respect and love of strangers.They fell in love with movies as this was the only form of escapism for them. Sly wanted to grow up and be a hero. The guy who saves people. He would spend hours in front of the mirror imitating actors. Steve Reeves in Hercules was the perfect role model for Sly.\nThe parents got divorced and Sly moved to Maryland with Frank Sr., while Frank went to Philadelphia with Jackie. Frank Sr. bought horses and Sly developed an affinity towards them and learned to play Polo. But his father didn't like Sly playing Polo and made him give up the game.\nFrank Sr. was very physical. Sly was a problem child and went to 13 schools in 12 years. He went to military school, but Sly was incorrigible. He started getting a bug for acting at the Devereaux School for wayward kids.He got into serious acting at college. He acted in a stage play of \"Death of a Salesman\". A Harvard professor in the audience told him to take up acting as a career. Sly comes back to New York, but all the agencies reject him as he slurs and his eyes droop. The best he gets are off-off Broadway shows, where he had to be half naked. He was always cast in movies as a thug.\nJohn Herzfeld was a director. Sly started to write as he could not get what he wanted. So, he created it himself. Sly had 15-16 screenplays in 2 years. He partnered with John during this phase. They had the same insulated personalities and they clicked as a team.They did a movie called Horses, where a cowboy and an Indian came up from their graves 100 years after they are hung. Frank Sr was cast as the Sherriff in the movie, who tracks them down and shoots them. It was a silent movie in 1971.\nSuddenly, Sly did an audition and landed a role in a movie.\nHenry Winkler meets Sly on the sets of \"The Lords of Flatbush\". Sly uses the opportunity to write his own dialogues for his scenes, which the director allows him to do. Sly realized that his fate was dependent on his writing skills. The Flatbush was the first movie where people liked his thug character.Sly drives down to Hollywood and meets Henry, as he is the only person he knows. Henry is the big star of the Fonzie show.\nSly doesn't get many auditions, so he starts to write. He is working on a derivative of Mean Streets and writing the character of a collection agent for the mob. But then on the advise of a woman he makes the character a bit soft. He has a girlfriend; he could hit people but stops almost short. Then, he added the fighting angle to the character, and it all came together.\nSly was offered $265,000 for the script, he had to stay away from the cast. Sly said that he was writing the movie for himself. Sly wanted his shot greatness. But all of the desired actors refused the movie, and they were replaced with perfect actors for the parts like Talia Shire.Budget was tight on the movie, but Sly used every obstacle as an opportunity. Rocky opens to bad reviews from the critics. At the premiere, 75% of the audience was gone in 20 minutes. But the movie opens in theaters and is a monster hit. The audience loved the underdog love story. Sly would never be unknown again.\nRocky wins an Oscar.Frank Sr contacts John with a script for the next Rocky movie called \"Sonny\". He was still competing with Sly. Fame wreaks havoc on families. The air at the top is thinner and it is lonely.\nSly was expected to repeat the magic with his next movie. He did FIST, based on the formation of a trucker's union in America. The problem with Sly was that he wanted to rewrite the movies he starred in and came in confrontation with the people hired by the studios. FIST is a flop.This inspires Sly to make his own movie. He did Paradise Alley, but it was a very niche film. The critic panned Paradise Alley as well.\nSo, Sly writes Rocky II and ends up directing it as well. The story mimics Sly's life in both Rocky and Apollo Creed characters. Rocky II makes twice the amount of money that Rocky made.\nBut the movie left no time to Sly for his own personal life.Sly does Rocky III. By this time his agents and his managers are asking him to play safe and not take risks in his movie. But Sly feels that he is losing his own hunger by listening to what everybody else is saying. He decides to do the movie his own way with Hulk Hogan and Mr T.\nRambo was an accident. He was a broken soldier from the war who returned home as a homicidal maniac. Sly rewrote the script and made Rambo more human and softer. Sly put stories from his real like into the movies that he wrote. The director wanted Rambo to die at the end of the movie, but Sly refused. He says that he didn't want every Vietnam vet to believe that there was no hope for them at all.Rambo made Sly the perfect 80's star. Arnold Schwarzenegger was his only competition. With Rambo, Sly challenged Arnie on his own turf of action movies. Sly became a force in Hollywood.\nRocky III and Rocky IV show Rocky as a comic book character with comic book villains. The real Sly was lost in those movies. Sly took a hit in Rocky IV and his heart hit his chest and started to swell. He went into Intensive care, but he survives.Sly was a polo player but had to give up due to back surgeries. He had 5 surgeries during his career. Sly retook Polo when he was 40 years old. In one game, his father speared him in the back, and he went down and injured his back.\nSly wrote his own son Sage into Rocky V. The tension between father son in the movie, was drawn from Sly's real life. The movie flops at the box office.\nSly does a comedy in the farce genre called \"Stop! Or my mom will shoot\". People did not accept him in comedies. He is the hulking action figure and goes back to his roots.Sly does Copland with De Niro. But the director doesn't have enough faith in Sly's abilities and how he wanted to shape the movie. The audience doesn't connect with the movie. Sly decides to become a specialist in his genre.\nSly revives the Rocky franchise 19 years after the first movie. Rocky Balboa is written. The movie was about dealing with how to move on. Its not about how hard you are hit, its about how hard you are hit and still keep moving forward. Life is an addition till you are 40, after that it is subtraction.\nSage dies in 2012.Sly comes up with age-appropriate action movies, when he is too old to star in Rocky or Rambo. He creates The Expendables. He was inspired by the revival of rock and roll, when thousands of people came to see the stars of the old days. Sly gathered an all star cast for his movie, a once great group from the 80's, 90's and the 2000's thrown into one pot.\nHe got injured on the sets and never recovered from it.Sly always felt that he was rejected by his own father. He has 3 daughters, Scarlet, Sistine and Sophia. He regrets not having given attention to his real life with his family.",

        "synopsis": "A mute John Doe with the mental capacity of a five-year-old is released from a mental hospital when the state cannot afford his treatment. He begins living on the streets and taking direction from whomever he comes across. While making a biopic about Billy the Kid, the Producer is incensed that method actor Sir Tom Bingsley refuses to leave his trailer. Since this costs the film time and money, the Producer resorts to using a stand-in. The Producer comes across the John Doe selling oranges on the street and hires him due to the striking resemblance to Bingsley. Meanwhile, Lenny is a struggling publicist who has not been able to maintain one client since moving to L.A. and bribes his way onto studio lots to look for talent. Lenny sees John Doe filming the biopic and misunderstands his name to be \"Latte Pronto\" due to the Producer demanding coffee. After Bingsley dies in a misguided method acting technique of hanging himself, \"Billy the Kid\" is forced to continue filming with Pronto as the star. Although hindered by Pronto's lack of acting talent and his continued looks directly into camera, his co-stars Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt are inspired by the supposed avant-garde performance and emulate his acting style. Lenny plans to propel Latte Pronto into stardom by getting him an agent and representation. Pronto is befriended by Luxt taking him to wild parties and showing him the Hollywood lifestyle. Simultaneously, Dior becomes infatuated with Pronto due to his sincerity. Dior convinces Pronto to marry her and they adopt several children, increasing their profiles in the media. \"Billy the Kid\" is a massive success, with critics praising Pronto's performance of breaking the fourth wall by looking into camera. At the after party, Lenny asks Pronto to confirm they will never end their business relationship. When Pronto cannot respond to Lenny's request, a security guard tries to escort Lenny out for disrupting the party. A fight breaks out with Pronto being blamed and sued by the security guard. The Agent asks Pronto to lay low from the media, while informing him of an offer to star in \"Mosquito Boy\" directed by Lex Tanner. While filming \"Mosquito Boy\", Pronto is taken out by Luxt for a night on the town which ends with the two in jail after assaulting a paparazzo. Even though Luxt was the aggressor, Pronto is blamed in the media. This further strains his relationship with his representation. While filming \"Mosquito Boy\", Pronto is injured and a stand-in is used for the majority of the movie. Lenny promises to publicize the film into a big hit regardless. The movie is a colossal failure at the box office and Pronto's representation leaves him. Dior is frustrated with her husband's failing stardom and controversies, so she divorces him, takes the children, and begins dating Luxt. Pronto is forced to move in with Lenny and the two bond over their mutual hardships. Lenny has a heart attack following his consumption of dozens of energy drinks. Pronto stays by his hospital bedside but leaves the room when a fan wants a selfie. Due to a mix-up with a nurse and a deceased patient, Pronto believes Lenny died while Lenny believes Pronto abandoned him. Lenny resolves to become a better person and successful publicist. Meanwhile, Pronto goes back to living on the street. Pronto befriends a homeless man named Dagger and saves his life, gaining media acclaim and is awarded the Key to the City by the Mayor of Los Angeles. The Mayor privately encourages Pronto to run for office on an anti-corporate platform since his acting career is over. The rich and powerful Cote brothers have Pronto kidnapped to discourage his political career. Ed Cote threatens his life should he oppose any of the Cotes' business interests.

        "synopsis": "Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison is a highly intelligent African-American upper-class writer and professor in Los Angeles. His novels receive academic praise, but sell poorly, and publishers reject his latest manuscript for not being \"black enough\". His university places him on temporary leave due to his brashness with students over racial issues and suggests he attend a literary seminar and spend time with family in his hometown, Boston. At the seminar, his panel is poorly attended, yet there is a packed room for an interview with Sintara Golden, whose bestselling novel We's Lives in Da Ghetto panders to black stereotypes.In Boston, Monk bonds with his mother Agnes, who shows signs of Alzheimer's disease, and sister Lisa, a physician. While having drinks with Monk, Lisa suffers a heart attack and later dies in the hospital. Monk's estranged brother, Cliff, a plastic surgeon, attends Lisa's funeral. Cliff is divorced after his wife caught him cheating with a man; he now engages in frequent drug use and casual sex. Monk meets and starts dating Coraline, a lawyer living across the street.Frustrated by Sintara's success and the costs of care for his mother, Monk writes My Pafology, a satirical novel mocking the literary clich\u00e9s expected from black writers: melodramatic plots, deadbeat dads, gang violence, drugs. After submitting it to publishers out of contempt, he is shocked to be offered a $750,000 advance, and his agent Arthur convinces him to adopt the persona of former convict \"Stagg R. Leigh\". As \"Stagg\", Monk is offered a movie deal from producer Wiley. In response to publishing executives' insulting comments, Monk tries to sabotage the deal by demanding the title be changed to Fuck. Unexpectedly, the executives agree. Monk is invited to help judge the New England Book Association's Literary Award as part of a \"diversity push\", and he reluctantly accepts. A fellow judge is Sintara, and Monk is surprised to learn she shares many of his views.Agnes moves into an assisted-living facility, but adapts poorly. Cliff briefly returns to Boston, but leaves after Agnes makes a homophobic remark. Fuck becomes a bestseller. Coraline, Cliff, and the public remain unaware that \"Stagg\" is Monk, and the FBI contacts the publisher, believing Stagg is a fugitive, as he claimed in interviews.On family-housekeeper Lorraine's wedding day, Monk finds Cliff living in Agnes's beach house with two other men: Cliff never left Boston and has been partying and doing drugs, but Lorraine is happy to have him attend the wedding. At the reception, Monk and Cliff discuss the impact of their father's suicide, and Cliff encourages Monk to let people \"love all of him.\"Monk's publisher submits Fuck for the literary award, forcing him to judge his own novel. The panel's white Limousine liberal judges rave over Fuck, though Sintara calls it \"pandering.\" Monk agrees, but later argues that Sintara's book is \"trauma porn\" and inauthentic to her African-American middle-class background. Sintara argues that she extensively researched her book by interviewing voiceless people, was \"giving the market what it wants,\" and that it is not her fault if white readers formed stereotypes from her book. Monk is even more offended when he finds that Coraline enjoyed reading Fuck; they argue and break up.At the award ceremony, Fuck is announced as the winner. Monk goes onstage and says he has a confession to make. The screen cuts to black, and the story is revealed to be Monk's screenplay based on his experiences, written for Wiley's production company as an alternative to the Fuck film adaptation. Monk has not revealed his identity to the public and is still separated from Coraline. Wiley likes the screenplay but asks Monk to write a different ending.Monk proposes one with his running away from the ceremony to apologize to his ex-girlfriend. Wiley doesn't like this, as it is closer to romantic comedy. Monk then suggests one where police, believing Monk to be a wanted criminal holding a gun, fatally shoot him at the ceremony. Much to Monk's dismay, Wiley (also busy filming blaxploitation film Plantation Annihilation) loves it, and the film moves into production. Monk drives away with Cliff after he and one of Wiley's actors, playing a slave, acknowledge each other.",

        "synopsis": "Jessica grew up on the sunshine coast in Australia !! The family lived next to the ocean. She practically lived on her family boat. She started sailing as a teenager. She was captivated by the allure of the sea. She studied the ocean for 4 yrs and learnt everything about sailing boats. She worked 3 part time jobs and saved money, to achieve her dream of sailing around the world.In 2009, 16-year-old Jessica Watson (Teagan Croft) dreams of becoming the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe non-stop and unassisted, which means she must sail alone and not dock at any port along the way. The journey is estimated to take 200 days, and she must cross the equator and all meridians of longitude. Her team consist of her parents (Julie (Anna Paquin), Roger (Josh Lawson)), three siblings (TOm (Stacy Clausen), Emily (Bridget Webb) & Hannah (Vivien Turner)), and her coach Ben Bryant (Cliff Curtis): a disgraced, former competitive sailor. When on her boat, the Pink Lady, Jessica communicates with the team via satellite phone. Ben has circumnavigated solo around the globe, 3 times himself\nJessica met Ben at the pier, when she was still a kid, and asked him to coach her. She says She is an adventurer and an explorer.On a test run, Jessica's boat is hit by a freighter that strayed off course. She didn't notice the oncoming ship because she forgot to turn on her alert system before going to bed. Ben asks the family not to call in the coast guard as the media is waiting for her to fail and would to see her limping back to dock in Sydney. She was only 20 miles away from Sydney.\nThe accident raises skepticism among the media as to whether Jessica can safely achieve her goal (this was night one of her only test run). Her parents are also worried, but continue to support her ambitions. She is a target, if she succeeds, she is a hero. If she sails, tragedy sells.\nJess is confident. She has sailed for 10,000 miles and she is qualified. She is prepared. The media questions her parents for being too irresponsible, given Jessica forgot to turn on her alarm system.. But they want her to follow her dreams.\nMedia also questions if Ben is the right coach, since he lost one of his crew members during the Millenium cup.Roger wants to buy new equipment to repair the damage on her boat. But they don't have enough money. Ben wants to patch things up where possible and get her on her way in 2 weeks, before the southern oceans fill up with ice. The sponsors are not responding to Jessica's call, and her hopes of making this yrs sailing deadline are fading fast.\nBen rounds up some of his mates, who are happy to volunteer, and get them working to fix Jessica's boat. to count as circumnavigation, Jessica cannot enter any port, has to cross all lines of longitude and round all 4 capes (Cape Horn, Cape Agulhas, Cape Leeuwin and the Cape of SE Tasmania).Jessica sets off on her journey from Sydney, Australia (on 18th Oct 2009), and things go smoothly (she calls in daily and provides her coordinates to Ben and Roger, who track her progress on a map.. Day 12, she is already nearing Fiji in the Pacific Ocean. Day 33 she crosses the equator 4356 miles from home) until she encounters her first big storm. Deciding to ride it out, Jessica lowers her sail (launches her drogue, which is kind of like a soft anchor) and retreats to her cabin. The waves are so violent that she is knocked unconscious and doesn't awake until the next morning. Her parents fear she is concussed, but Jessica assures them she's fine and continues her trip.\nDay 50 and she nears the South American coast. She maintains a video blog and Hannah shares the address with the press. Soon, the video blog goes Viral. Day 72 she is 9504 miles away from home, in the Pacific OCean.\nCape horn is always tough. This is where the Pacific Ocean meets the Atlantic Ocean and leads to winds and currents crashing into each other, resulting in huge waves. Jessica gets to Cape Horn on day 82, 10824 miles from home.A period of no wind occurs around day 113, 12884 miles from home, and Jessica's boat remains stationary for a week. During this time, she suffers from depression and loneliness. She has a heated argument with Ben and cruelly reminds him that, while competing in the New Zealand Millennium Cup, one of his crew members died under his command. He angrily quits the project in response. Jessica's mother encourages her frustrated daughter to lift her spirits by singing David Bowie's \"Starman\" while looking at the brightest star in the sky.The wind returns after more than a week and Jessica continues her journey. She eventually nears Australia and is about one thousand miles from Sydney. Before she can reach home, she encounters three storms that merge. Her mother asks her to head to port and abandon her circumnavigation attempt. winds are 70 kmph with 40 foot swells. Ben returns and advises her to alter the route (which would make her miss the 4th cape), effectively abandoning her official circumnavigation. Jessica refuses to give up and chooses to ride it out. Meanwhile she is aware that the boat is springing a leak and would not withstand the pressure of a monster storm. Her plan is not to use the drogue and instead move her boat with the storms to reduce the pressure on its hull. She is up against 60 foot waves and she plans to ride over them. Day 198, Jessica takes the storm, head on.\nThe storm proves to be far more violent than the last one. The Pink Lady capsizes and is thrust 15 feet (4.5 meters) underwater. This sets off the boat's emergency locator beacon, and the team fears Jessica may have drowned.The Pink Lady, however, resurfaces and rights herself. Jessica informs her family that she and the boat are safe. She returns to Sydney Harbor, 210 days after she left. Her team and a crowd spectators (80,000 strong at the Sydney Harbor) are there to welcome her home on 15th May 2010.\nThe epilogue reveals that Jessica was named the 2011 Young Australian of the Year, has written two books despite having dyslexia, and is still an avid sailor.",

        "synopsis": "In 1993, five ordinary teenagers were selected by the powerful space entity Zordon to protect the Earth from the evil witch Rita Repulsa. Thirty years later, many more have taken up the mantle as the universe's protectors, known as the Power Rangers.Billy Cranston lays injured on a clifftop, surrounded by dozens of Putty Patrollers under the command of Rita Repulsa, reformed in a robotic body. Billy rises to his feet and morphs into the Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger as Rita orders her putties to finish him. Billy fights valiantly, but is overwhelmed by the putties and Rita, who blasts him back with her wand. As the putties approach, Jason Lee Scott, Tommy Oliver, Trini Kwan, Zack Taylor, and Kimbery Hart teleport in front of him, already morphed into the Red, Green, Yellow, Black, and Pink Rangers. Billy had already called them for help and lured Robo Rita into the open so they could find them. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers spring into action, working together to battle the army of putties. Billy gets close to Rita and smashes her metal faceplate. Angered, Rita counter attacks, and shoots him again with her staff. While Billy is down, Rita decides to use some of her life power to create a bolt of deadly energy, and sends it hurling at the Blue Ranger. Seeing this, Trini jumps in the way to protect him, and is killed. Rita retreats to gather her strength, promising to return, and leaves the five remaining rangers devastated at the loss of their friend.Jason, Kimberly, and Tommy go to the Dark Dimension to look for Rita. At Trini's house, Zack and Billy argue about what to tell Trini's teenage daughter, Minh. With her mom gone, Minh has no one left. Billy thinks they should tell her the truth, including that her mother was a power ranger. Zack insists that Minh is only a kid, and this sudden revelation could be too much for her, not to mention Zordon forbade them from ever revealing their identities. Billy argues that Zordon would approve in this case, as Minh would see through any lie they could try to concoct, and there is no easy way to tell her that her mother has been killed. Minh walks in as they are debating, and hears this. As she runs off, Billy tells Zack they have to explain everything.One year later, Minh is training her Kung Fu outside. Zack has retired from his career as a congressman and become Minh's legal guardian. Meanwhile the rangers have spent the past year hunting down Robo Rita, but have so far found nothing. Zack reminds her that they are supposed to meet the others at the cemetery to commemorate Trini. As they approach the graveside, Minh thanks \"Uncle Zack\" for everything he's done for her, and they ruminate on the previous year's events. They suddenly hear the others call on their morphers, and rush up to find them facing down Robo Rita, along with two of her reconstructed monsters, Robo Minitaur, and Robo Snizzard. Rita has brought along a large mechanism, and is ready to put her plans of world domination in action. The rangers attack, and Zack tells Minh to stay in cover while he morphs to join them. They battle it out with the monsters, and Rita gives Snizzard a signal. Snizzard bites Jason, paralyzing him and wrapping him in snakes, which shrink him down. Jason is given to Rita and placed into her machine, and Snizaard soon does the same with Tommy and Kimberly. Outnumbered and outmatched, Zack tells Billy they need to retreat. They demorph and, along with Minh, get into Billy's car; the Radbug 2. The monsters try to stop them by blocking the road, but Billy activates the car's flight, and they soar away to safety. Rita promises that soon, they and all other power rangers will join Trini. Back at the house, the two rangers try to figure out what Rita's machine does. Whatever it is, Billy suspects that it will take their friends' lives. Minh want's to go after Rita and destroy her, but the two men tell her she cannot join them in this. Minh feels it is her right to avenge her mother, but they are worried she will get herself killed as well. When Billy points out that she is not a ranger and they cannot risk losing her, Minh blames him for her mom's death, and argues that if it weren't for him, Trini would still be alive. She storms off, and Billy and Zack head to Billy's tech company, Cranston Technologies, to get the equipment they need.On the moon, Rita's palace has been rebuilt. The powers of the three captured rangers are draining too slow, so she orders Snizzard and Minotaur to find and capture more. Minotaur can track power rangers once they are morphed, so Rita decides to lure them out. Deep beneath Cranston Tech, the Command Center is also rebuilt. Zack and Billy enter to find Alpha-9, the latest iteration of Alpha robots, tending the monitors. He greets them, but Billy is absent. Zack asks him if he is okay, but the Blue Ranger feels guilty about what Minh said, and agrees with her that Trini's death was his fault. Zack rejects this, but Billy recalls that day. One year previous, Billy works in the Command Center with Alpha-9's predecessor, Alpha-8. Having constructed a plasma tube, they attempt to reconstitute Zordon from any trace of him that remained after his sacrifice in the Z-Wave. They get a lock on something, and thinking it's their long lost mentor, they initialize the process. Something forms in the tube, but soon causes tremors in the building and breaks free, consuming Alpha-8. Alpha knocks Billy away and is taken over by Rita Repulsa, who uses her magic to transform the robot into her new body. Billy is shocked to see their old enemy, and she tells him that the Z-Wave scattered her essence along with Zordon's, until Billy gave her a path back. She attacks him, and he escapes outside, calling the others. Back in the present, Zack tells Billy that they need to focus on stopping Rita before she can hurt anyone else. The alarm sounds, and they see on the monitors that legions of putties have begun attacking all over the world. Billy commands Alpha to initiate their contingency plan, the Bandora Protocol. Alpha sends out the alert to all power ranger teams to prepare for battle. Two rangers teleport directly to the Command Center; Katherine, Tommy's wife and the second Pink Ranger, and Rocky, the second Red Ranger. Rocky is tired from his shift as a firefighter, and Kat has left her and Tommy's son J.J. at his karate camp. They suspect the call is one of Billy's emergency drills, but are soon brought up to speed with the situation.Back home, Minh is training furiously, frustrated that Zack will not let her join him. She sees the Putty attack on the news. Resolved to fight, she takes her mother's morpher and goes to help. At the Command Center, Billy tells the others they need to prepare in case their zords are needed. While the Saber-Tooth Tiger Zord has been reconfigured to work without a pilot, the Pterodactyl and Tyrannosaurus Zords need rangers to operate them. Alpha presents Rocky and Kat with secondary Power Coins, connected with the Morphin Grid, that should allow them to morph. Despite the risk involved in using duplicate powers, Kat and Rocky are ready to rejoin the fight. The four rangers morph, and teleport into the city to confront the putties. Angel Grove is in chaos as the putties attack civilians. The rangers start fighting them off, shepherding the populace to safety. In Rita's base, Minotaur detects the morphed rangers. He and Snizzard appear on Earth to try and catch them, and Rocky nearly gets bitten before Billy helps him escape. With the civilians safe, the rangers teleport away. Minotaur continues to track them, but he and Snizzard are overheard by Alpha who has been monitoring the fight on local security cameras. He contacts the rangers all over the world and tells them that the monsters can track them while they are morphed, they only way to escape is to power down and retreat. The Mighty Morphin Rangers finish saving the people of Angel Grove, and do as Alpha says, demorphing and teleporting back to the Command Center before Snizzard and Minotaur can catch up to them. Back at headquarters, Alpha detects Rita's base on the moon as it gathers energy. The team get a transmission from Adam and Aisha, who are fighting the Troobian Empire in space. Unfortunately, they are too far away to teleport back and help, but they are on their way. With civilians all over the worlds still in danger, Rocky wants to head to the moon and face Rita head on. However, as long as Snizzard and Minotaur are after them, they cannot morph. They come up with a plan to trap the monsters, but Zack notices Minh fighting the putties alone at Ernie's Juice Bar and Youth Center.Minh fights off a large group of putties and clears the way for the teens at the youth center to escape. She tries to use the yellow morpher, but it does not respond to her. Despite her best efforts, she is eventually surrounded and subdued by the footsoldiers until Zack arrives with Rocky. The two older rangers defeat the putties, and take Minh back to the Command Center. Kat has found what they need for their plan, so Rocky and Billy teleport out to meet her, leaving Zack to talk with Minh alone. He makes her hand over the morpher, and berates her for disobeying him and putting herself in danger. He tells her he never wanted to reveal their ranger lives to her, it was Billy insisted she needed to know the truth. Minh feels that Zack is being hypocritical, since he and the others were all fighting the bad guys at her age. She claims she knows the responsibilities of being a ranger, but Zack recognizes that she only wants revenge on Rita, and points out that Rita herself is only after revenge. He tells her that the only way to be a hero is to set aside her anger, towards Rita, and towards Billy. He tells her about Zordon and how much he meant to all of them, which is why Billy was trying to bring him back when the remnants of Rita broke through instead. Minh takes it all in, and Zack asks her to stay put for now.In a junkyard, Billy supercharges a crane magnet, and Kat lifts it into place. The three morph, and wait for Minotaur and Snizzard to show up. On the moon base, the monsters have captured more rangers from around the world, and set them into the machine. The device is nearing full charge as Minotaur detects Billy, Kat, and Rocky. The robotic monsters go to find them, and are caught in the super magnet. With the monsters out of the way, they meet the others and prepare to infiltrate the moon palace. Minh doesn't understand why they don't just destroy Snizzard and Minotaur, but Billy explains that finishing them when they are trapped is not the plan. The adults take handheld invisibility shields that Billy developed for Adam and Aisha, and Alpha teleports them to the moon base. Minh decides to end the monsters herself, and takes Trini's morpher and one of the invisibility shields to sneak out of the Command Center. She takes the Radbug 2 and finds civilians in danger. She runs over the putties attacking them, and accidentally activates the car's flight mode. She makes it to the junkyard and finds Snizzard and Minotaur, still trapped. She attempts once again to morph, but the power coin does not bond with her. Rita appears, amused at finding another teen trying to play hero. Minh uses Trini's Praying Mantis Technique to fight Rita, but is no match for the space witch.On the moon, the invisible rangers easily take down the putties guarding the machine. Billy warns them not to remove the captured and miniaturized rangers, as disconnecting them from the device while Snizzard's snakes are attached to them could kill them. The will have to destroy Snizzard in order to safely remove their friends. Before they can leave, Zack and Rocky see a vision in the energy created by the machine, which shows Rita's space dumpster that she was released from all those years ago. Billy realizes that Robo Rita's device is a time machine. Rita appears behind them, along with Minotaur, Snizzard, and a captive Minh. She tells them that she will go through the time portal and give decades of knowledge to her younger self, but not before slaughtering Jason, Zack, Billy, Kimberly, and Trini before Zordon can recruit them as power rangers. Billy secretly summons his blade blaster and signals Zack to attack Rita. He fires on Snizzard, but the snake lizard monster is too quick and dodges him. Zack, Rocky, and Kat try to take Rita down, but she brushes them all off before throwing Billy to the ground with her magic. She gloats in Trini's sacrifice to save him before, and forms the killing spell once again. As she fires, Minh breaks free from Minotaur and leaps in the way, taking the shot. She is knocked to the ground, unresponsive as the others desperately try to revive her. Suddenly, the yellow morpher glows, having seemingly protected Minh from the deadly spell, and Minh sees memories of Trini's time as the Yellow Ranger. She wakes up, and the Saber-Tooth Tiger Power Coin bonds with her. Her honorary uncles invite her to sound the call, and the five rangers morph and summon their power weapons. The Power Rangers make quick work of Rita's putties, but they cannot destroy the machine until Snizzard his snakes are defeated. Robo Rita throws Snizzard out onto the lunar surface and uses her magic want to grow him giant. While she is distracted, Billy runs her through with his power lance, seemingly disabling her. The Blue and Yellow Rangers call Alpha to send them their Dino Zords, who awake from their hiding places and teleport to the moon, assembling into Megazord. Billy and Minh get into the cockpit, and Billy shows her how to pilot the massive zord as they clash with Snizzard.\nIn the palace, The Black, Pink, and Red Rangers finish off Minotaur, and join the others in the Megazord. Snizzard is a tough enemy, and it takes all of their abilities to hold him off. Meanwhile, Robo Rita reactivates, and her time machine is fully energized. She opens the time portal, and sees the astronauts approaching her space dumpster, and setting Rita Repulsa free. The rangers summon the Power Sword and end Snizzard, breaking his hold on their fellow rangers. Rita is about to go through the time portal and join her younger self, but the rangers appear behind her as Minh pins her to the wall with her daggers. Billy and Rocky disconnect their friends from the machine, and Kat obliterates it with her power bow. As the portal closes, Zack destroys Robo Rita with his power axe. With the threat finally over, they return to Earth.In the Command Center, Alpha tells Adam and Aisha that the rescued power rangers have been put into their ship's medical bay, awaiting transport to Aquitar to help them recover. Adam asks Billy if he will be coming with them, as Cestria misses him. He tells them that he still has business to attend to on Earth, but assures them he will return once the rangers are back to full strength. Aisha welcomes Minh as the new Yellow Ranger, and she, Adam, Rocky, and Kat say their farewells as Alpha teleports them home.Later, Zack, Minh, and Billy are at juice bar, and Billy gives Minh her very own wrist communicator. Zack leaves to get smoothies, and Billy asks Minh if she wants anything from space when he leaves. She asks him not to stay away too long, telling him that Trini always missed him when he was gone, and admits that she will miss him too. She apologizes for what she said about her mom's death being his fault, and tells him that he shouldn't feel guilty, thanking him for telling her the truth about Trini. He in turn thanks her for saving his life, and she replies that he is family. When Zack returns, Minh tells them how the morpher showed her memories of her mom when it got blasted, and she could tell how much they all meant to her. Billy and Zack start to tell Minh stories of their adventures with Trini, who eagerly takes in every word.In a flashback, Kimberly and Zack sing a song they wrote to their friends, Jason, Billy, Tommy, and Trini, in honor of their unbreakable bond with eachother.",

        "synopsis": "In 1968, a staid yet respected Southern California pastor, Chuck Smith, finds that his church is slowly dying with an inability to connect with the younger, live-free generation of hippies. One day, his daughter, Janette, gives a ride to a colorful hippie hitchhiker named Lonnie Frisbee, who says he is traveling around and telling people about the Ministry of Jesus. Smith, at first suspicious of Frisbee, eventually warms up to him and welcomes other hippies to his house. This includes Lonnie introducing Chuck to a band called Love Song, who proceeds to perform a song in his living room. They join forces and start a successful movement to evangelize hippies and others. Meanwhile, high-school student Greg Laurie runs away from his Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps class and joins a girl named Cathe who \"turns him on\" to a Janis Joplin concert, with Timothy Leary preaching the value of drugs for self-discovery. However, Greg sees that various hippies are dangerously irresponsible; Cathe's sister gets sick from a drug overdose. When watching a movie, Cathe gets angry at Greg for not caring about how dangerous drugs are and breaks their friendship. At the hippie campus, Cathe is listening to Lonnie preach; Greg then comes over and they reconcile, ending with Cathe telling him she found a church and he should come visit. Greg and Cathe find solace at Smith and Frisbee's ministry, though Cathe's uptight parents are not enthusiastic about Greg. The ministry explodes in popularity, being seen as a \"Jesus Revolution\" or \"Jesus freaks\", and even sparking a Time magazine cover in 1971.[4] However, Lonnie eventually leaves for Florida after having disagreements with Chuck Smith. Greg offers to take over a ministry branch in Riverside, and eventually marries Cathe and becomes a famous pastor himself. Smith and Frisbee are remembered as founders of the widespread Calvary Chapel movement, and more generally as leaders in the Jesus movement.",
